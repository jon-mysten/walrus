Epoch 1 begun on March 25, 2025. The\\nnetwork can now be used to\\n[publish and retrieve blobs](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs),\\n[upload and browse Walrus Sites](/docs/sites/getting-started/publishing-your-first-site), as\\nwell as [stake and unstake](https://stake-wal.wal.app/) to determine future committees using the\\nlive\\n[Mainnet WAL token](https://www.walrus.xyz/wal-token).\\nOn Mainnet, the Walrus security properties hold. And Walrus is now ready to satisfy\\nthe needs of real applications.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nWalrus is [open source](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus).\\nThe Walrus protocol health is overseen by an\\n[independent foundation](https://www.walrus.xyz/) that is now\\n[well resourced](https://www.walrus.xyz/blog/walrus-foundation-fundraising) to support future\\ndevelopment and growth.\\nAnd, the community is collecting tools, resources and dapps for Walrus under\\n[Awesome Walrus!](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-walrus)\\n\\nThis is a significant milestone a little over 12 months after an initial small team started\\ndesigning the Walrus protocol. And a special thanks is due to the community of storage operators\\nthat supported the development of Walrus through consecutive Testnet(s), as well as all\\ncommunity members that integrated the protocol early and provided feedback to improve it.\\n\\n## New features\\n\\nBesides the promise of stability and security, the Mainnet release of Walrus comes with a few\\nnotable new features and changes:\\n\\n- **Blob attributes.** Each Sui blob objects can have multiple attributes and values attached to it,\\n  to encode application meta-data. The aggregator uses this facility for returning common HTTP\\n  headers.\\n\\n- **Burn blob objects on Sui**. The command line `walrus` tool is extended with commands to\\n  \\"burn\\" Sui blob objects to reclaim the associated storage fee, making it cheaper to store blobs.\\n\\n- **CLI expiry time improvements.** Now blob expiry can be expressed more flexibly when storing\\n  blobs, through `--epochs max`, an RFC3339 date with `--earliest-expiry-time`, or the concrete end\\n  epoch with `--end-epoch`.\\n\\n- **RedStuff with Reed-Solomon codes.** The erasure code underlying\\n  RedStuff was changed from RaptorQ to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Intense benchmarking suggests their\\n  performance, for our parameter set, is similar, and the use of RS codes provides perfect\\n  robustness, in that blobs can always be reconstructed given a threshold of slivers. We\\n  thank [Joachim Neu](https://www.jneu.net/) for extensive feedback on this topic.\\n\\n- **TLS handing for storage node.** Storage nodes can now be configured to serve TLS certificates\\n  that are publicly trusted, such as those issues by cloud providers and public authorities such as\\n  Let\'s Encrypt. This allows JavaScript clients to directly store and retrieve blobs from Walrus.\\n\\n- **JWT authentication for publisher.** Now the publisher can be configured to only provide\\n  services to authenticated users via consuming JWT tokens that can be distributed through any\\n  authentication mechanism.\\n\\n- **Extensive logging and metrics.** All services, from the storage node to aggregator and publisher\\n  export metrics that can be used to build dashboards, and logs at multiple levels to troubleshoot\\n  their operation.\\n\\n- **Health endpoint.** Storage nodes and the CLI include a `health` command to check the status and\\n  basic information of storage nodes. This is useful when allocating stake as well as monitoring\\n  the network.\\n\\n- **Walrus Sites updates.** The Mainnet Walrus Sites public portal will be hosted on the\\n  `wal.app` domain name. Now Walrus Sites support deletable blobs to make their updates more\\n  capital efficient. Those operating their own portals may also use their own domain names to serve\\n  a Walrus Site. The\\n  [Staking](https://stake-wal.wal.app/),\\n  [Docs](/docs/getting-started),\\n  [Snowreads](https://snowreads.wal.app), and\\n  [Flatland](https://flatland.wal.app)\\n  Walrus Sites are now on Mainnet.\\n\\n- **A subsidies contract.** The Mainnet release of Walrus requires WAL for storing blobs, however\\n  to enable early adopters to try the system, transition to it, the Walrus foundation operates a\\n  smart contract to\\n  [acquire subsidized storage](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/contracts/subsidies).\\n  The CLI client uses it automatically when storing blobs.\\n\\n## Testnet future plans\\n\\nThe current Walrus Testnet will soon be wiped and restarted to align the codebase to the Mainnet\\nrelease. Going forward we will regularly wipe the Testnet, every few months. Developers should use\\nthe Walrus Mainnet to get any level of stability. The Walrus Testnet is only there to test new\\nfeatures before they are deployed in production.\\n\\nWe will not be operating a public portal to serve Walrus Sites on Testnet, to reduce costs and\\nincident response associated with free web hosting. Developers can still run a local portal\\npointed to Testnet to test Walrus Sites.\\n\\n## Open source Walrus codebase\\n\\nThe Walrus codebase, including all smart contracts in Move, services in Rust, and documentation, is\\nnow open sourced under an Apache 2.0 license, and hosted on\\n[GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus). Since the main Walrus repository is now open to all,\\nand contains both documentation and smart contracts, we are retiring the `walrus-docs` repository.\\n\\nDevelopers may find the Rust CLI client, and associated aggregator and publisher services of most\\ninterest. These can be extended to specialize services to specific operational needs. They are\\nalso a good illustration of how to interface with Walrus using Rust clients. A cleaner and more\\nstable Rust SDK is in the works as well.\\n\\n## Publisher improvements and plans\\n\\nPublishing blobs on Mainnet consumes real WAL and SUI. To avoid uncontrolled costs to operations the\\npublisher service was augmented with facilities to authenticate requests and account for costs per\\nuser."},{"id":"/05_testnet_redeployment","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/05_testnet_redeployment","source":"@site/../blog/05_testnet_redeployment.mdx","title":"Announcing Testnet v2","description":"We are today redeploying the Walrus Testnet to incorporate various improvements, including some","date":"2025-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.55,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing Testnet v2","date":"2025-01-16T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing Mainnet","permalink":"/blog/06_mainnet"},"nextItem":{"title":"Announcing Walrus: A Decentralized Storage and Data Availability Protocol","permalink":"/blog/01_announcing_walrus"}},"content":"We are today redeploying the Walrus Testnet to incorporate various improvements, including some\\nbackwards-incompatible changes. Make sure to get the latest binary and configuration as described\\nin the [setup section](/docs/getting-started/advanced-setup).\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nNote that all blob data on the previous Testnet instance has been wiped. All blobs need to be\\nre-uploaded to the new Testnet instance, including Walrus Sites. In addition, there is a new version\\nof the WAL token, so your previous WAL tokens will not work anymore. To use the Testnet v2, you\\nneed to obtain new WAL tokens.\\n\\nIn the following sections, we describe the notable changes and the actions required for existing\\nWalrus Sites.\\n\\n## Epoch duration\\n\\nThe epoch duration has been increased from one day to two days to emphasize that this duration is\\ndifferent from Sui epochs (at Mainnet, epochs will likely be multiple weeks long). In addition, the\\nmaximum number of epochs a blob can be stored for has been reduced from 200 to 183 (corresponding\\nto one year).\\n\\nThe `walrus store` command now also supports the `--epochs max` flag, which will store\\nthe blob for the maximum number of epochs. Note that the `--epochs` flag is now mandatory.\\n\\n## New features\\n\\nBesides many improvements to the contracts and the storage-node service, the latest Walrus release\\nalso brings several user-facing improvements.\\n\\n- The `walrus store` command now supports storing multiple files at once. This is faster and more\\n  cost-effective compared to storing each file separately as transactions can be batched through\\n  [PTBs](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks). Notably, this is compatible\\n  with glob patterns offered by many shells, so you can for example run a command like `walrus store\\n  *.png --epochs 100` to store all PNG files in the current directory.\\n- The `walrus` CLI now supports creating, funding, and extending *shared blobs* using the `walrus\\n  share`, `walrus store --share`, and `walrus fund-shared-blob` commands. Shared blobs are an\\n  example of collectively managed and funded blobs. See the [shared blobs section](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs#shared-blobs) for more details.\\n\\n## New WAL token\\n\\nAlong with the redeployment of Walrus, we have also deployed a fresh WAL contract. This\\nmeans that you cannot use any WAL token from the previous Testnet instance with the new Testnet\\ninstance. You need to request new WAL tokens through the [Testnet WAL faucet](/docs/system-overview/available-networks#testnet-wal-faucet).\\n\\n## Backwards-incompatible changes\\n\\nOne reason for a full redeployment is to allow us to make some changes that are\\nbackwards-incompatible. Many of those are related to the contracts and thus less visible to users.\\nThere are, however, some changes that may affect you.\\n\\n### Configuration files\\n\\nThe format of the configuration files for storage nodes and clients has been changed. Make sure to\\nuse the latest version of the configuration files, see the [configuration section](/docs/getting-started/advanced-setup#configuration).\\n\\n### CLI options\\n\\nSeveral CLI options of the `walrus` CLI have been changed. Notably, all \\"short\\" variants of options\\n(e.g., `-e` instead of `--epochs`) have been removed to prevent future confusion with new options.\\nAdditionally, the `--epochs` flag is now mandatory for the `walrus store` command (this also affects\\nthe [JSON API](/docs/walrus-client/json-mode)).\\n\\nPlease refer to the CLI help (`walrus --help`, or `walrus <command> --help`) for further details.\\n\\n### HTTP APIs\\n\\nThe paths, request, and response formats of the HTTP APIs have changed for the storage nodes, and\\nalso the aggregator and publisher. Please refer to the section on the [HTTP API](/docs/http-api/storing-blobs) for further details.\\n\\n## Effects on and actions required for existing Walrus Sites\\n\\nThe Walrus Sites contracts have not changed, which means that all corresponding objects on Sui are\\nstill valid. However, the resources now point to blob IDs that do not yet exist on the new Testnet.\\nThe easiest way to fix existing sites is to simply update them with the `--force` flag:\\n\\n```sh\\nsite-builder update --epochs <number of epochs> --force <path to site> <existing site object>\\n```\\n\\n## New Move contracts & documentation\\n\\nAs part of the new Testnet release of Walrus, the Move smart contracts have been updated; the\\ndeployed version can be found in the [`walrus-docs`\\nrepository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/tree/main/contracts)."},{"id":"/01_announcing_walrus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/01_announcing_walrus","source":"@site/../blog/01_announcing_walrus.mdx","title":"Announcing Walrus: A Decentralized Storage and Data Availability Protocol","description":"Walrus is an innovative decentralized storage network for blockchain apps and autonomous agents.

The\\nWalrus storage system is being released today as a developer preview for Sui builders in order to\\ngather feedback. We expect a broad rollout to other web3 communities very soon!\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nLeveraging innovations in erasure coding, Walrus enables fast and robust encoding of unstructured\\ndata blobs into smaller slivers distributed and stored over a network of storage nodes. A subset of\\nslivers can be used to rapidly reconstruct the original blob, even when up to two-thirds of the\\nslivers are missing. This is possible while keeping the replication factor down to a minimal 4x-5x,\\nsimilar to existing cloud-based services, but with the additional benefits of decentralization and\\nresilience to more widespread faults.\\n\\n## The Replication Challenge\\n\\nSui is the most advanced blockchain system in relation to storage on validators, with innovations\\nsuch as a [storage fund](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/tokenomics/storage-fund) that future-proofs\\nthe cost of storing data on-chain. Nevertheless, Sui still requires complete data replication among\\nall validators, resulting in a replication factor of 100x or more in today\u2019s Sui Mainnet. While this\\nis necessary for replicated computing and smart contracts acting on the state of the blockchain, it\\nis inefficient for simply storing unstructured data blobs, such as music, video, blockchain history,\\netc.\\n\\n## Introducing Walrus: Efficient and Robust Decentralized Storage\\n\\nTo tackle the challenge of high replication costs, Mysten Labs has developed Walrus, a decentralized\\nstorage network offering exceptional data availability and robustness with a minimal replication\\nfactor of 4x-5x. Walrus provides two key benefits:\\n\\n1. **Cost-Effective Blob Storage:** Walrus allows for the uploading of gigabytes of data at a time\\n    with minimal cost, making it an ideal solution for storing large volumes of data. Walrus can do\\n    this because the data blob is transmitted only once over the network, and storage nodes only\\n    spend a fraction of resources compared to the blob size. As a result, the more storage nodes the\\n    system has, the fewer resources each storage node uses per blob.\\n\\n1. **High Availability and Robustness:** Data stored on Walrus enjoys enhanced reliability and\\n    availability under fault conditions. Data recovery is still possible even if two-thirds of the\\n    storage nodes crash or come under adversarial control. Further, availability may be certified\\n    efficiently without downloading the full blob.\\n\\nDecentralized storage can take multiple forms in modern ecosystems. For instance, it offers better\\nguarantees for digital assets traded as NFTs. Unlike current designs that store data off-chain,\\ndecentralized storage ensures users own the actual resource, not just metadata, mitigating risks of\\ndata being taken down or misrepresented.\\n\\nAdditionally, decentralized storage is not only useful for storing data such as pictures or files\\nwith high availability; it can also double as a low-cost data availability layer for rollups. Here,\\nsequencers can upload transactions on Walrus, and the rollup executor only needs to temporarily\\nreconstruct them for execution.\\n\\nWe also believe Walrus will accompany existing disaster recovery strategies for millions of\\nenterprise companies. Not only is Walrus low-cost, it also provides unmatched layers of data\\navailability, integrity, transparency, and resilience that centralized solutions by design cannot\\noffer.\\n\\nWalrus is powered by the Sui Network and scales horizontally to hundreds or thousands of networked\\ndecentralized storage nodes. This should enable Walrus to offer Exabytes of storage at costs\\ncompetitive with current centralized offerings, given the higher assurance and decentralization.\\n\\n## The Future of Walrus\\n\\nBy releasing this developer preview we hope to share some of the design decisions with the\\ndecentralized app developer community and gather feedback on the approach and the APIs for storing,\\nretrieving, and certifying blobs. In this developer preview, all storage nodes are operated by\\nMysten Labs to help us understand use cases, fix bugs, and improve the performance of the software.\\n\\nFuture updates to Walrus will allow for dynamically changing the set of decentralized storage nodes,\\nas well as changing the mapping of what slivers are managed by each storage node. The available\\noperations and tools will also be expanded to cover more storage-related use cases. Many of these\\nfunctions will be designed with the feedback we gather in mind.\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates on how Walrus will revolutionize data storage in the web3 ecosystem.\\n\\n## What can developers build?\\n\\nAs part of this developer preview, we provide a binary client (currently macOS, ubuntu) that can be\\noperated from the [command line interface](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs), a [JSON API](/docs/walrus-client/json-mode), and an [HTTP API](/docs/http-api/storing-blobs). We also offer the community an aggregator and\\npublisher service and a Devnet deployment of 10 storage nodes operated by Mysten Labs.\\n\\nWe hope developers will experiment with building applications that leverage the Walrus Decentralized\\nStore in a variety of ways. As examples, we hope to see the community build:\\n\\n- **Storage of media for NFT or dapps:** Walrus can directly store and serve media such as images,\\n  sounds, sprites, videos, other game assets, etc. This is publicly available media that can be\\n  accessed using HTTP requests at caches to create multimedia dapps.\\n\\n- **AI-related use cases:** Walrus can store clean data sets of training data, datasets with a known\\n  and verified provenance, model weights, and proofs of correct training for AI models. Or it may be\\n  used to store and ensure the availability and authenticity of an AI model output.\\n\\n- **Storage of long term archival of blockchain history:** Walrus can be used as a lower-cost\\n  decentralized store to store blockchain history. For Sui, this can include sequences of\\n  checkpoints with all associated transaction and effects content, as well as historic snapshots of\\n  the blockchain state, code, or binaries.\\n\\n- **Support availability for L2s:** Walrus enables parties to certify the availability of blobs, as\\n  required by L2s that need data to be stored and attested as available to all. This may also\\n  include the availability of extra audit data such as validity proofs, zero-knowledge proofs of\\n  correct execution, or large fraud proofs.\\n\\n- **Support a full decentralized web experience:** Walrus can host full decentralized web\\n  experiences including all resources (such as js, css, html, and media). These can provide content\\n  but also host the UX of dapps, enabling fully decentralized front- and back-ends on chain. It\\n  brings the full \\"web\\" back into \\"web3\\".\\n\\n- **Support subscription models for media:** Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus and only\\n  provide access via decryption keys to parties that have paid a subscription fee or have paid for\\n  content. (Note that Walrus provides the storage; encryption and decryption must be done off\\n  Walrus).\\n\\nWe are excited to see what else the web3 developer community can imagine!\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nFor this developer preview the public Walrus Devnet is openly available to all developers. Developer\\ndocumentation is available at `<https://docs.wal.app>`.\\n\\nSUI Testnet token is the main currency for interacting with Walrus. Developers pay for Walrus Devnet\\nstorage using SUI Testnet tokens which can be acquired at the [Sui Testnet Discord\\nfaucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966).\\n\\n## One more thing \u2026\\n\\nThe [Walrus Sites website](https://walrus.site), the [Walrus docs](/docs/getting-started), and\\n[this very blog](https://blog.walrus.site) are hosted on Walrus.

The Testnet also brings functionality updates relating to governance,\\nepochs, and blob deletion.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Blob deletion\\n\\nThe most important user-facing new feature is optional blob deletion. The uploader of a blob can\\noptionally indicate a blob is \\"deletable\\". This information is stored in the Sui blob metadata\\nobject, and is also included in the event denoting when the blob is certified. Subsequently, the\\nowner of the Sui blob metadata object can \\"delete\\" it. As a result storage for the remaining\\nperiod is reclaimed and can be used by subsequent blob storage operations.\\n\\nBlob deletion allows more fine-grained storage cost management: smart contracts that wrap blob\\nmetadata objects can define logic that stores blobs and delete them to minimize costs, and reclaim\\nstorage space before Walrus epochs end.\\n\\nHowever, blob deletion is not an effective privacy mechanism in itself: copies of the blob may exist\\noutside Walrus storage nodes on caches and end-user stores or devices. Furthermore, if the identical\\nblob is stored by multiple Walrus users, the blob will still be available on Walrus until no copy\\nexists. Thus deleting your own copy of a blob cannot guarantee that it is deleted from Walrus as a\\nwhole.\\n\\n- Find out how to\\n  [upload and delete deletable blobs](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs#reclaiming-space-via-deletable-blobs)\\n  through the CLI.\\n- Find out more about how [delete operations work](/docs/system-overview/operations#delete).\\n\\n## Epochs\\n\\nWalrus Testnet enables multiple epochs. Initially, the epoch duration is set to a single day to\\nensure the logic of epoch change is thoroughly tested. At Mainnet, epochs will likely be multiple\\nweeks long.\\n\\nThe progress of epochs makes the expiry epoch of blobs meaningful, and blobs will become unavailable\\nafter their expiry epoch. The store command may be used to extend the expiry epoch of a blob that is\\nstill available. This operation is efficient and only affects payments and metadata, and does not\\nre-upload blob contents.\\n\\n- Find out the [current epoch](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs#walrus-system-information) through the CLI.\\n- Find out how to store a blob for\\n  [multiple epochs](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs).\\n\\n## The WAL token and the Testnet WAL faucet\\n\\nPayments for blob storage and extending blob expiry are denominated in Testnet WAL, a\\nWalrus token issued on the Sui Testnet. Testnet WAL has no value, and an unlimited supply; so no\\nneed to covet or hoard it, it\'s just for testing purposes and only issued on Sui Testnet.\\n\\nWAL also has a smaller unit called FROST, similar to MIST for SUI. 1 WAL is equal to 1 billion\\n(1000000000) FROST.\\n\\nTo make Testnet WAL available to all who want to experiment with the Walrus Testnet we provide a\\nutility and smart contract to convert Testnet SUI (which also has no value) into Testnet WAL using\\na one-to-one exchange rate. This is chosen arbitrarily, and generally one should not read too much\\ninto the actual WAL denominated costs of storage on Testnet. They have been chosen arbitrarily.\\n\\nFind out how to [request Testnet WAL tokens](/docs/system-overview/available-networks#testnet-wal-faucet) through the CLI.\\n\\n## Decentralization through staking & unstaking\\n\\nThe WAL token may also be used to stake with storage operators. Staked WAL can be unstaked and\\nre-staked with other operators or used to purchase storage.\\n\\nEach epoch storage nodes are selected and allocated storage shards according to their delegated\\nstake. At the end of each epoch payments for storing blobs for the epoch are distributed to storage\\nnodes and those that delegate stake to them. Furthermore, important network parameters (such as\\ntotal available storage and storage price) are set by the selected storage operators each epoch\\naccording to their stake weight.\\n\\nA staking web dApp is provided to experiment with this functionality. Community members have also\\ncreated explorers that can be used to view storage nodes when considering who to stake with. Staking\\nensures that the ultimate governance of Walrus, directly in terms of storage nodes, and indirectly\\nin terms of parameters and software they chose, rests with WAL Token holders.\\n\\nUnder the hood and over the next months we will be testing many aspects of epoch changes and\\nstorage node committee changes: better shard allocation mechanisms upon changes or storage node\\nstake; efficient ways to sync state between storage nodes; as well as better ways for storage nodes\\nto follow Sui event streams.\\n\\n- Explore the [Walrus staking dApp](https://stake.walrus.site).\\n- Look at recent activity on the [Walrus Explorer](https://walruscan.com/testnet/home).\\n\\n## New Move contracts & documentation\\n\\nAs part of the Testnet release of Walrus, the documentation and Move Smart contracts have been\\nupdated, and can be found in the [`walrus-docs`\\nrepository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs).\\n\\n## New Walrus Sites features\\n\\nWith the move to Walrus Testnet, Walrus Sites have also been updated! The new features in this\\nupdate greatly increase the flexibility, speed, and security of Walrus Sites. Developers can now\\nspecify client-side routing rules, and add custom HTTP headers to the portals\' responses for their\\nsite, expanding the possibilities for what Walrus Sites can do.\\n\\nMigrate now to take advantage of these new features! The old Walrus Sites, based on Walrus Devnet,\\nwill still be available for a short time. However, Devnet will be wiped soon (as described below),\\nso it is recommended to migrate as soon as possible.\\n\\n## Discontinuation of Walrus Devnet\\n\\nThe previous Walrus Devnet instance is now deprecated and **will be shut down after 2024-10-31**.\\nAll data stored on Walrus Devnet (including Walrus Sites) will no longer be accessible at that\\npoint.

Further details about the\\nproject, such as timelines, opportunities for community participation, how to join the network as a\\nstorage node, and plans around light nodes, will be shared in subsequent posts.\\n\\nTo be part of this journey:\\n\\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://x.com/WalrusProtocol)\\n- Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/walrusprotocol)\\n- [Build apps](/docs/getting-started) on Walrus\\n- [Publish a Walrus Site](/docs/sites/introduction/components) and share it"},{"id":"/02_devnet_update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/02_devnet_update","source":"@site/../blog/02_devnet_update.mdx","title":"Devnet Update","description":"We have redeployed the Walrus Devnet to incorporate various improvements to the Walrus storage nodes","date":"2024-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.91,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Devnet Update","date":"2024-08-12T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing the Official Walrus Whitepaper","permalink":"/blog/03_whitepaper"}},"content":"We have redeployed the Walrus Devnet to incorporate various improvements to the Walrus storage nodes\\nand clients. In this process, all blobs stored on Walrus were wiped. Note that this may happen again\\non Devnet and Testnet, but obviously *not on the future Mainnet*.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Migration and Re-deployment of Walrus Sites\\n\\nYou can obtain the latest version of the `walrus` binary and the new configuration as described in\\nthe [setup chapter](/docs/getting-started/advanced-setup).\\n\\nIf you had deployed any Walrus Sites, the site object on Sui and any SuiNS name are still valid.\\nHowever, you need to re-store all blobs on Walrus. You can achieve this by running the site-builder\\ntool (from the `walrus-sites` directory) as follows:\\n\\n```sh\\n./target/release/site-builder --config site-builder/assets/builder-example.yaml update --force \\\\\\n    <path to the site> <site object ID>\\n```\\n\\n## Changes\\n\\nBesides many improvements to the storage nodes, the new version of Walrus includes the following\\nuser-facing changes:\\n\\n- Improved coin management: The client now better selects coins for gas and storage fees. Users no\\n  longer require multiple coins in their wallet.\\n- Improved connection management: The client now limits the number of parallel connections to\\n  improve performance for users with low network bandwidth storing large blobs.\\n- OpenAPI specification: Walrus storage nodes, aggregators, and publishers expose their API\\n  specifications at the path `/v1/api`.\\n- System info in JSON: The `info` command is now also available in JSON mode.\\n- Client version: The `walrus` CLI now has a `--version` option.\\n- Support for the empty blob: The empty blob is now supported by Walrus.\\n- Default configuration-file paths: The client now looks for configuration files in\\n  `~/.config/walrus` in addition to `~/.walrus` and recognizes the extension `.yml` in addition to\\n  `.yaml`.\\n- Home directory in paths: Paths specified in configuration files now expand the `~` symbol at the\\n  beginning to the user\'s home directory.\\n- More robust store and status check: The `store` and `blob-status` commands are now more robust\\n  against Sui full nodes that aggressively prune past events and against load-balancers that send\\n  transactions to different full nodes.\\n- Fix CLI parsing: The `walrus` CLI now properly handles hyphens in blob IDs.\\n\\nThis update also increases the number of shards to 1000, which is more representative of the\\nexpected value in Testnet and Mainnet."}]}}')}}]);
