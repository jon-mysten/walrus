govern your use of the website, the <!-- -->user<!-- --> interface, and other offerings located at walrus.xyz, (the
“Site”) offered by Walrus Foundation (“Walrus Foundation,” “we,” “our”). To make these Terms easier
to read, the Site and our services (including Beta Services) are collectively called the
“Interface.” The Interface may facilitate interaction with the Walrus decentralized cryptographic
protocols, maintained by third party open source communities, which we do not own or control (the
“Protocol”) allowing for activities such as the creation of non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), blockchain
games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market makers, website hosting, data storage providers,
and wallets. BY USING THESE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE NOT A PERSON OR ENTITY WHO IS
RESIDENT IN, A CITIZEN OF, IS LOCATED IN, IS INCORPORATED IN, OR HAS A REGISTERED OFFICE IN ANY
RESTRICTED TERRITORY, AS DEFINED BELOW (ANY SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY FROM A RESTRICTED TERRITORY, ARE
REFERRED TO HEREIN AS A “RESTRICTED PERSON”).WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH
LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND WALRUS FOUNDATION THROUGH BINDING,
INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 15 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION”
BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 16 WILL NOT
APPLY TO YOU, BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 15 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p>Agreement to Terms</p>
<p>By using our Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by
the Terms, do not use the Interface.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Interface, for information
on how we collect, use and share your information.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Changes to these Terms or the Interface</p>
<p>We may update the Terms, including any addendum terms, from time to time in our sole discretion.
If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site and/or may also send other
communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the
Interface. If you continue to use the Interface after we have posted updated Terms it means that
you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not
use the Interface anymore. Because our Interface is evolving over time we may change or
discontinue all or any part of the Interface, at any time and without notice, at our sole
discretion.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Interface Use Eligibility</p>
<p>a) Eligibility. The Interface is only available to users in certain jurisdictions that are at
least 18 years old, capable of forming a binding contract with the Walrus Foundation and not
otherwise barred from using the Interface as permitted under Applicable Law. You may not attempt
to access or use the Interface if you are not permitted to do so.</p>
<p>b) Compliance. You certify that you will comply with all Applicable Law when using the
Interface. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the Interface in
such country, territory, or jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws. You must not use
any software or networking techniques, including use of a virtual private network (“VPN”) to
circumvent or attempt to circumvent this prohibition. We reserve the right to monitor the
locations from which our Interface is accessed. Furthermore, we reserve the right, at any time,
in our sole discretion, to block access to the Interface, in whole or in part, from any
geographic location, IP addresses, and unique device identifiers, or to any <!-- -->user<!-- --> who we believe
is in breach of these Terms.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Use of the Interface</p>
<p>a) <!-- -->User<!-- --> Representations and Warranties. As a condition to accessing or using the Interface, you
represent and warrant to the Walrus Foundation the following:</p>
<p>(i) if you are entering into these Terms as an individual, then you are of legal age in the
jurisdiction in which you reside and you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms and
be bound by them and if you are entering into these Terms as an entity, then you must have the
legal authority to accept these Terms on that entity’s behalf, in which case “you” (except as
used in this paragraph) will mean that entity;</p>
<p>(ii) you are in or residing in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Belarus, Russia, and the Crimea,
Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions of Ukraine, or any other country or
jurisdiction to which the Cayman Islands, the United Kingdom, United States, the United Nations
Security Council, or the European Union embargoes goods or imposes similar sanctions
(collectively, “Restricted Territories”);</p>
<p>(iii) you are not on any sanctions list or equivalent maintained by the Cayman Islands, the
United Kingdom, United States, the United Nations Security Council, or the European Union
(collectively, “Sanctions Lists Persons”) and you do not intend to transact with any Restricted
Person or Sanctions List Person;</p>
<p>(iv) you do not, and will not, use VPN software or any other privacy or anonymization tools or
techniques to circumvent, or attempt to circumvent, any restrictions that apply to the
Interface;</p>
<p>(v) you have obtained all required consents from any individual whose personal information you
transfer to us in connection with your use of the Interface; and</p>
<p>(vi) your access to the Interface is not: (a) prohibited by and does not otherwise violate or
assist you to violate any domestic or foreign law, rule, statute, regulation, by-law, order,
protocol, code, decree, or another directive, requirement, or guideline, published or in force
that applies to or is otherwise intended to govern or regulate any person, property,
transaction, activity, event or other matter, including any rule, order, judgment, directive or
other requirement or guideline issued by any federal, provincial or state, municipal, local or
other governmental, regulatory, judicial or administrative authority having jurisdiction over
Walrus Foundation, you, the Site or the Interface, or as otherwise duly enacted, enforceable by
law, the common law or equity (collectively, “Applicable Laws”); or (b) contribute to or
facilitate any illegal activity.</p>
<p>b) Limitations. As a condition to accessing or using the Interface or the Site, you acknowledge,
understand, and agree to the following:</p>
<p>(i) from time to time the Site and the Interface may be inaccessible or inoperable for any
reason, including, without limitation: (a) equipment malfunctions; (b) periodic maintenance
procedures or repairs that Walrus Foundation or any of its suppliers or contractors may
undertake from time to time; (c) causes beyond Walrus Foundation’s control or that Walrus
Foundation could not reasonably foresee; (d) disruptions and temporary or permanent
unavailability of underlying blockchain infrastructure; or (e) unavailability of third-party
service providers or external partners for any reason;</p>
<p>(ii) the Site and the Interface may evolve, which means Walrus Foundation may apply changes,
replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the Interface at any time in its sole
discretion;</p>
<p>(iii) Walrus Foundation does not act as an agent for you or any other <!-- -->user<!-- --> of the Site or the
Interface;</p>
<p>(iv) you are solely responsible for your use of the Interface; and</p>
<p>(v) we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent
any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, you hereby irrevocably disclaim,
waive, and eliminate those duties and liabilities.</p>
<p>c) Certifications. As a condition to accessing or using the Interface, you covenant to Walrus
Foundation the following:</p>
<p>(i) you will comply with all Applicable Laws in connection with using the Interface, and you
will not use the Site or the Interface if the laws of your country, or any other Applicable Law,
prohibit you from doing so; and</p>
<p>(ii) in addition to complying with all restrictions, prohibitions, and other provisions of these
Terms, you will ensure that, at all times, all information that you provide through the
Interface is current, complete, and accurate and you will maintain the security and
confidentiality of your private keys associated with your public wallet address, passwords, API
keys, private keys associated with your Interface account and other related credentials.</p>
<p>d) Tax Records and Reporting. You are solely responsible for all costs incurred by you in using
the Interface, and for determining, collecting, reporting, and paying all applicable Taxes that
you may be required by law to collect and remit to any governmental or regulatory agencies.  As
used herein, “Taxes” means the taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other charges imposed by any
federal, state, multinational or local governmental or regulatory authority. We reserve the
right to report any activity occurring using the Interface to relevant tax authorities as
required under Applicable Law. You are solely responsible for maintaining all relevant Tax
records and complying with any reporting requirements you may have as related to our Interface.
You are further solely responsible for independently maintaining the accuracy of any record
submitted to any tax authority including any information derived from the Interface.</p>
<p>e) Costs and Fees. Each party shall be responsible for all Taxes imposed on its income or
property. In addition, you agree to pay any applicable fees, including Gas Fees and hosting
fees, in connection with transactions on the Interface. “Gas Fees” mean the fees that fund the
network of computers that run the decentralized blockchain network, meaning that you will need
to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the blockchain network.</p>
<p>f) Suspensions or Terminations. In addition to the other suspension and termination rights in
these Terms, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Interface at any time in connection
with any transaction as required by Applicable Law, any governmental authority, or if we in our
sole and reasonable discretion determine you are violating the terms of any third-party service
provider or these Terms, including, without limitation, if we reasonably believe any of your
representations and warranties may be untrue or inaccurate or you are violating or have violated
any of the geographical restrictions that apply to the Interface, and we will not be liable to
you for any losses or damages you may suffer as a result of or in connection with the Site or
the Interface being inaccessible to you at any time or for any reason. Such suspension or
termination shall not constitute a breach of these Terms by Walrus Foundation. In accordance
with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and
practices, we may impose limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to
utilize the Interface. Such limitations may include rejecting transaction requests, freezing
funds, or otherwise restricting you from using the Interface, all to the extent of our ability
to do so.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Beta Services</p>
<p>a) We may offer some of the Services, including without limitation the testnet or devnet
environments (“Testnet” and “Devnet”), in beta version (collectively, “Beta Services”). You
acknowledge and agree that: (a) the Beta Services may not operate properly, be in final form or
be fully functional; (b) the Beta Services may contain errors, design flaws or other problems;
(c) it may not be possible to make the Beta Services fully functional; (d) the information
obtained using the Beta Services may not be accurate; (e) use of the Beta Services may result in
unexpected results, loss of data or communications, project delays or other unpredictable damage
or loss; (f) we are under no obligation to release a live, commercial or public version of the
Beta Services; (g) we have the right to unilaterally to abandon development of the Beta
Services, at any time and without any obligation or liability to you; and (h) we may decide to
modify, delete, remove or wipe the functionality, content or data contained within the Beta
Services in our sole discretion at any time without notice or liability to you.</p>
<p>b) In your use of the Testnet or Devnet, you may accumulate Testnet or Devnet tokens
(collectively, “Beta Tokens”) such as through a faucet, which are not, and shall never convert
to or accrue to become any other tokens or virtual assets outside of the respective Testnet or
Devnet on which such Beta Tokens were issued. Beta Tokens are virtual items with no monetary
value. Beta Tokens do not constitute any currency or property of any type and are not
redeemable, refundable, or eligible for any fiat or virtual currency (including any rewards
offered by Walrus Foundation) or anything else of value. Walrus Foundation does not guarantee
that Beta Tokens will continue to be offered for a specific length of time and you may not rely
upon the continued availability of any Beta Tokens. You acknowledge that you have no property
interest in the Beta Tokens.  If the Beta Services expire, you acknowledge and agree that your
access to and use of your Beta Tokens will be removed, and all accrued Beta Tokens will be
deleted from the Beta Service environments. Beta Tokens are not transferable between users
outside of the respective Testnet or Devnet on which such Beta Tokens were issued, and you may
not attempt to sell, trade, or transfer any Tokens outside of that respective Testnet or Devnet,
or obtain any manner of credit using any Beta Tokens. Any attempt to sell, trade, or transfer
any Beta Tokens outside of the respective Testnet or Devnet will be null and void.</p>

<li class="">
<p>Your Content</p>
<p>a) <!-- -->User<!-- --> Content. Our Interface may allow you to store or share content such as text (in posts or
communications with others), files, documents, graphics, images, music, software, code, audio
and video. Anything (other than Feedback) that you post or otherwise make available through the
Interface is referred to as “<!-- -->User<!-- --> Content.” Walrus Foundation does not claim any ownership
rights in any Walrus Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights
that you may have to your <!-- -->User<!-- --> Content.</p>
<p>b) Permissions to Your <!-- -->User<!-- --> Content. By making any Walrus Content available through the
Interface you hereby grant to Walrus Foundation a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide,
royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative
works based upon, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your <!-- -->User<!-- --> Content in
connection with operating, providing, and improving the Interface.</p>

AND WHETHER OR NOT WALRUS FOUNDATION OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF
ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WALRUS
FOUNDATION’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF
OR INABILITY TO USE THE INTERFACE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).THE EXCLUSIONS AND
LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN
BETWEEN WALRUS FOUNDATION AND YOU.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Governing Law and Forum Choice</p>
<p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands
without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>dispute Resolution</p>
<p>a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy
arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement,
interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, “Disputes”) will
be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or
consolidated action or proceeding. You and Walrus Foundation agree that the Cayman Islands
Arbitration Law governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and
Walrus Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>b) Exceptions. The Parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a
court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property
rights.</p>
<p>c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. These Terms will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to or application of conflicts
of law rules or principles.  Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, including the formation, interpretation, breach or termination
thereof, including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable, will be referred to and finally
resolved by binding arbitration to be administered by the Cayman Islands International Centre
(CIAC) and governed by the Arbitration Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands.  The arbitration
shall be conducted in the English language and the place of arbitration shall be in the Cayman
Islands.  The number of arbitrators shall be one.  The place of arbitration will be George Town,
Cayman Islands.  The decision of the sole arbitrator to any such dispute, controversy,
difference or claim shall be final and binding upon both parties.  If any litigation or
arbitration is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be
entitled to have their attorney fees paid by the other party.  Each party waives any right it
may have to assert the doctrine of forum non conveniens, to assert that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of such arbitration or courts or to object to venue to the extent any proceeding is
brought in accordance herewith. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section
16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim
asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public
injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of
prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and
extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall
be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
<p>d) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WALRUS FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS <!-- -->MEMBER<!-- --> IN ANY
PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved
through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your
claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If
this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute
Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>
<p>e) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 16(d) of these Terms
(“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any
part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still
apply.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>General Terms</p>
<p>a) Reservation of Rights. Walrus Foundation and its licensors exclusively own all right, title
and interest in and to the Interface, including all associated intellectual property rights. You

United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright,
trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the
Interface.</p>
<p>b) Entire Agreement. These Terms, including any addendum terms, constitute the entire and
exclusive understanding and agreement between Walrus Foundation and you regarding the Interface,
and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements
between Walrus Foundation and you regarding the Interface. If any provision of these Terms is
held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that
provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these
Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>c) Assignment. Except where provided by Applicable Law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign
or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Walrus Foundation’s prior
written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your
statutory right, will be null. Walrus Foundation may freely assign or transfer these Terms
without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of
the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<p>d) Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by Walrus Foundation under these Terms
will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Interface. For notices made by email,
the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. Waiver of
Rights. Walrus Foundation’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will
be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Walrus
Foundation. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of
its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms
or otherwise.</p>
