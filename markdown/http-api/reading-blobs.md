You can read blobs using HTTP GET requests and their blob ID or object ID.

### Blob IDs

For example, the following cURL command reads a blob and writes it to an output file:

```sh
$ curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/<some blob ID>" -o <some file name>
```

Alternatively, you can print the contents of a blob in the terminal with the cURL command:

```sh
$ curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/<some blob ID>"
```

:::tip

Modern browsers attempt to sniff the content type for such resources, and generally do a good job of inferring content types for media. However, the aggregator on purpose prevents such sniffing from inferring dangerous executable types such as JavaScript or style sheet types.

### Object ID

You can also read blobs by using the object ID of a Sui blob object or a shared blob. For example, the following cURL command downloads the blob corresponding to a Sui object ID:

```sh
$ curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/by-object-id/<object-id>" -o <some file name>
```

Downloading blobs by object ID allows setting some HTTP headers. The aggregator recognizes the following attribute keys and returns the values in the corresponding HTTP headers when present:

- `content-disposition`

- `content-encoding`

- `content-language`

- `content-location`

- `content-type`

- `link`

### Consistency checks

The consistency checks performed by the aggregator are the same as the ones [performed by the CLI](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs#consistency-checks). For special use cases, the [strict consistency check](/docs/design/encoding) can be enabled by adding a query parameter `strict_consistency_check=true` (starting with `v1.35`). If the writer of the blob is known and trusted, you can disable the consistency check by adding a query parameter `skip_consistency_check=true` (starting with `v1.36`).
