You can read blobs using HTTP GET requests with their blob ID or object ID.

> **Reading a blob right after upload?**
>
> When you read through a CDN-fronted aggregator immediately after certification, the CDN might briefly cache a `404` from before the blob propagated. If your app knows the blob was just certified, retry with backoff. See [Reading Blobs Right After Upload](/docs/troubleshooting/reading-blobs-after-upload).
## Reading by blob ID

The following `curl` command reads a blob and writes it to an output file:

```sh
$ curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/<BLOB_ID>" -o <FILE_NAME>
```

To print the contents of a blob directly in the terminal:

```sh
$ curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/<BLOB_ID>"
```

> **Tip**
>
> Modern browsers attempt to sniff the content type for these resources and generally do a good job of inferring content types for media. The aggregator intentionally prevents sniffing from inferring dangerous executable types such as JavaScript or style sheet types.
## Reading by object ID

You can also read blobs by using the object ID of a Sui blob object or a shared blob. The following `curl` command downloads the blob corresponding to a Sui object ID:

```sh
$ curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/by-object-id/<OBJECT_ID>" -o <FILE_NAME>
```

Downloading blobs by object ID allows setting HTTP headers. The aggregator recognizes the following attribute keys and returns the values in the corresponding HTTP headers when present: `content-disposition`, `content-encoding`, `content-language`, `content-location`, `content-type`, and `link`.

## Consistency checks

The consistency checks performed by the aggregator are the same as those [performed by the CLI](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs#consistency-checks). For special use cases, you can enable the [strict consistency check](/docs/system-overview/red-stuff) by adding a query parameter `strict_consistency_check=true` (starting with `v1.35`). If the writer of the blob is known and trusted, you can disable the consistency check by adding a query parameter `skip_consistency_check=true` (starting with `v1.36`).
