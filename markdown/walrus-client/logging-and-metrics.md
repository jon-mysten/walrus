The `walrus` CLI allows for multiple levels of logging, which can be turned on through an environment variable:

```sh
$ RUST_LOG=walrus=trace walrus info
```

By default `info` level logs are enabled, but `debug` and `trace` can give a more in depth understanding of what a command does or how it fails.
