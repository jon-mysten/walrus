The status of a blob can be queried through one of the following commands:

```sh
$ walrus blob-status --blob-id <BLOB_ID>
$ walrus blob-status --file <FILE>
```

Each command returns output that indicates whether the specified blob is stored and its availability period. If you specify a file with the `--file` option, the CLI re-encodes the content of the file and derives the blob ID before checking the status.

When a blob is available, the `blob-status` command also returns the `BlobCertified` Sui event ID, which consists of a transaction ID and a sequence number in the events emitted by the transaction. The existence of this event certifies the availability of the blob.

## Read blobs

Reading blobs from Walrus can be achieved using the following command:

```sh
$ walrus read <some blob ID>
```

By default, blob data is written to the standard output. The `--out <OUT>` CLI option can be used to specify an output file name. The `--rpc-url <URL>` can be used to specify a Sui RPC node to use instead of the currently configured RPC node set in the CLI configuration file or wallet configuration.

### Check consistency

Walrus performs integrity and consistency checks to ensure that any data read from Walrus is what the writer intended, and that the writer encoded the blob correctly. See the [data consistency](/docs/design/encoding) documentation for further details. 

Prior to `v1.37`, the Walrus CLI and aggregator always performed the [strict consistency check](/docs/design/encoding). Starting with `v1.37`, the default is a [more performant consistency check](/docs/design/encoding), which is sufficient for the majority of cases. The strict consistency check can be enabled through the flag `--strict-consistency-check`.

Consistency checks can be disabled completely with the flag `--skip-consistency-check`. This should only be used if the writer of the blob is known and trusted.

### Read blobs from a quilt

You can retrieve individual blobs from a quilt without downloading the entire quilt. The `read-quilt` command allows you to query for specific blobs by their identifier, tags, or unique blob ID.

To read blobs by their identifiers, use the `--identifiers` flag:

```sh
$ walrus read-quilt --out <download dir> \
    --quilt-id 057MX9PAaUIQLliItM_khR_cp5jPHzJWf-CuJr1z1ik --identifiers walrus.jpg another-walrus.jpg
```

Blobs within a quilt can be accessed and filtered based on their tags. For instance, if you have a collection of animal images stored in a quilt, each labeled with a species tag such as `species=cat`, you can download all images labeled as cats with the following command:

```sh
$ walrus read-quilt --out <download dir> \
    --quilt-id 057MX9PAaUIQLliItM_khR_cp5jPHzJWf-CuJr1z1ik --tag species cat
```

You can also read a blob using its `QuiltPatchId`, which can be retrieved using `walrus list-patches-in-quilt`:

```sh
$ walrus read-quilt --out <download dir> \
  --quilt-patch-ids GRSuRSQ_hLYR9nyo7mlBlS7MLQVSSXRrfPVOxF6n6XcBuQG8AQ \
  GRSuRSQ_hLYR9nyo7mlBlS7MLQVSSXRrfPVOxF6n6XcBwgHHAQ
```

To see all the patches contained within a quilt, along with their identifiers and `QuiltPatchIds`, use the `list-patches-in-quilt` command.

```sh
$ walrus list-patches-in-quilt 057MX9PAaUIQLliItM_khR_cp5jPHzJWf-CuJr1z1ik
```
