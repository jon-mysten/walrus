## Extend the lifetime of a blob

Walrus blob lifetimes can be extended using the `walrus extend --blob-obj-id <Sui object id> ...` command as long as the blob is not expired. Both address owned blobs and [shared blobs](#shared-blobs) can have their lifetime extended. Shared blobs can be extended by anyone, but owned blobs can only be extended by their owner. When extending a shared blob, you need to supply the `--shared` flag to inform the command that the blob is shared.

The blob's object ID is needed in order to extend it. The blob ID is not needed. See `walrus extend --help` for more information on blob extension.

## Reclaim space through deletable blobs

A blob that was set as deletable upon creation can be deleted before its expiry, but only by the owner of the Sui object corresponding to the blob. Deletable blobs are indicated as such in the Sui events that certify them, and should not be relied upon by others for availability.

Delete a blob with the command:

```sh
$ walrus delete --blob-id <BLOB_ID>
```

The delete command can also be invoked by specifying a `--file <PATH>` option to derive the blob ID from a file, or using `--object-id <SUI_ID>`. Before deleting a blob, the `walrus delete` command asks for confirmation unless the `--yes` option is specified.

The `delete` command reclaims the storage object associated with the deleted blob, which is re-used to store new blobs automatically. The delete operation provides flexibility around managing [storage costs](/docs/system-overview/storage-costs) and re-using storage.

The delete operation has limited utility for privacy. It only deletes slivers from the current epoch storage nodes, and subsequent epoch storage nodes, if no other user has uploaded a copy of the same blob. If another copy of the same blob exists in Walrus, the delete operation does not make the blob unavailable for download, and `walrus read` invocations will still download it. After the deletion is finished, the CLI checks the updated status of the blob to see if it is still accessible in Walrus, unless the `--no-status-check` option was specified. However, even if the blob is not accessible, copies of the public blob might be cached or downloaded by users, and these copies are not deleted.

:::danger

All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all. The `delete` command does not delete slivers if other copies of the blob are stored on Walrus, possibly by other users. It does not delete blobs from caches, slivers from past storage nodes, or copies that could have been made by users before the blob was deleted.

## Shared blobs

Shared blobs are shared Sui objects wrapping standard `Blob` objects that can be funded and whose lifetime can be extended by anyone. See the [shared blobs contracts](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/contracts/walrus/sources/system/shared_blob.move) for further details.

You can create a shared blob from an existing `Blob` object you own with the `walrus share` command:

```sh
$ walrus share --blob-obj-id <SUI_OBJ_ID>
```

The resulting shared blob can be directly funded by adding an `--amount`, or you can fund an existing shared blob with the `walrus fund-shared-blob` command. Additionally, you can immediately share a newly created blob by adding the `--share` option to the `walrus store` command.

Shared blobs can only contain permanent blobs and as such cannot be deleted before their expiry.
