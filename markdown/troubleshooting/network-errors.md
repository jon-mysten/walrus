This page covers common errors you might encounter when using Walrus. Each entry includes the error message, its cause, and how to troubleshoot it.

## Configuration errors

Errors in this section occur when the Walrus CLI cannot load or parse its configuration.

#### `could not find a valid Walrus configuration file`

**Cause:** The CLI cannot find a configuration file in any of the default locations.

**Solution:** Create the configuration directory and download a fresh configuration file:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/walrus
$ curl https://docs.wal.app/setup/client_config.yaml -o ~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml
```

If your configuration file is stored in a non-default location, you can specify a custom path:

```
$ walrus info --config /path/to/client_config.yaml
```

#### `unable to parse the client config file`

**Cause:** The configuration file has invalid YAML syntax, is missing required fields such as `system_object` or `staking_object`, or contains typos in field names.

**Solution:** Validate the YAML syntax and verify that all required fields are present.

Alternatively, download a fresh configuration file:

```
$ curl https://docs.wal.app/setup/client_config.yaml -o ~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml
```

If you download a fresh file, be aware that any custom configuration may be overwritten or lost. Take precaution to preserve necessary configuration parameters. 

#### `the specified Walrus system object does not exist`

**Cause:** The configuration points to a Walrus system object that does not exist on the current Sui network. This happens when you use an outdated configuration, or you target the wrong network.

**Solution:** Download the latest configuration for your target network. Verify that your Sui wallet is configured for the correct network (Mainnet or Testnet).

#### `Sui RPC url is not specified as a CLI argument or in the client configuration, and no valid Sui wallet was provided`

**Cause:** The CLI cannot determine which Sui RPC endpoint to use. No RPC URL was provided through `--rpc-url`, the configuration file does not contain RPC URLs, and no valid wallet was found.

**Solution:** Specify an RPC URL directly:

```
$ walrus info --rpc-url https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443
```

Alternatively, add RPC URLs to your configuration file or verify that your Sui wallet is properly configured.

#### `cannot connect to Sui RPC nodes at URLS`

**Cause:** The CLI cannot establish a connection to any of the specified Sui RPC endpoints.

**Solution:** Check your internet connection and verify the RPC URLs are correct. Try a different RPC endpoint:

```
$ walrus info --rpc-url https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443
```

## Storage duration errors

Errors in this section occur when specifying how long to store a blob.

#### `either epochs or earliest_expiry_time or end_epoch must be provided`

**Cause:** No storage duration was specified when storing a blob.

**Solution:** Provide one duration option when storing:

```
$ walrus store file.txt --epochs 5
```

You can also use `--earliest-expiry-time` or `--end-epoch` instead.

#### `exactly one of epochs, earliest-expiry-time, or end-epoch must be specified`

**Cause:** Multiple storage duration options were provided. Only one is allowed per command.

**Solution:** Provide exactly one of `--epochs`, `--earliest-expiry-time`, or `--end-epoch`.

#### `invalid epoch count; please a number >0 or max`

**Cause:** An invalid value was provided for the `--epochs` flag.

**Solution:** Provide a positive integer or `max` for the `--epochs` flag.

#### `blobs can only be stored for up to MAX_EPOCHS epochs ahead`

**Cause:** The requested storage duration exceeds the maximum allowed. The current maximum is 53 epochs.

**Solution:** Reduce the number of epochs, or use `--epochs max` to store for the maximum allowed duration. Check the current maximum with `walrus info`.

#### `expiry time is too far in the future`

**Cause:** The specified `--earliest-expiry-time` value exceeds the maximum allowed duration.

**Solution:** Use a shorter duration. Check the maximum epochs allowed with `walrus info`.

#### `end_epoch must be greater than the current epoch`

**Cause:** The `--end-epoch` value is not greater than the current epoch.

**Solution:** Provide an `--end-epoch` value that is greater than the current epoch. Check the current epoch with `walrus info epoch`.

#### `earliest_expiry_time must be greater than the current epoch start time and the current time`

**Cause:** The `--earliest-expiry-time` value is in the past.

**Solution:** Provide a value that is in the future relative to both the current epoch start time and the current wall-clock time.

## Input and validation errors

Errors in this section occur when command arguments are missing or invalid.

#### `either the file or blob ID must be defined`

**Cause:** A command requiring a blob identifier was called without providing one.

**Solution:** Provide either `--file` or `--blob-id`.

#### `no files, blob IDs, or object IDs specified`

**Cause:** A command such as `delete` or `burn-blobs` was called without providing any identifiers.

**Solution:** Provide at least one of `--files`, `--blob-id`, or `--object-id`.

#### `deletable blobs cannot be shared`

**Cause:** You attempted to share a deletable blob. Only permanent blobs can be shared.

**Solution:** Create the blob with `--permanent` if you intend to share it.

#### `exactly one of objectIds, all, or allExpired must be specified`

**Cause:** Multiple or no selection options were provided to `burn-blobs`.

**Solution:** Provide exactly one of `--object-ids`, `--all`, or `--all-expired`.

#### `cannot provide both paths and blob_inputs`

**Cause:** Both `--paths` and `--blobs` options were provided to `store-quilt`.

**Solution:** Use either `--paths` or `--blobs`, not both.

#### `either paths or blob_inputs must be provided`

**Cause:** No input was provided to `store-quilt`.

**Solution:** Provide either `--paths` or `--blobs`.

#### `exactly one of address or object must be set`

**Cause:** A command requires either an address or object ID, but both or neither were provided.

**Solution:** Provide exactly one of the required options.

#### `exactly one of nodeId, nodeUrl, committee, or activeSet must be specified`

**Cause:** Multiple or no node selection options were provided to a command such as `health`.

**Solution:** Provide exactly one of `--node-id`, `--node-url`, `--committee`, or `--active-set`.

#### `node URL URL not found in active set`

**Cause:** The provided node URL does not match any node in the active set.

**Solution:** Verify the node URL is correct, or use `--node-id` instead.

#### Quilt query pattern errors

**Error:**

```
Exactly one query pattern must be specified. Valid query patterns are:
- quiltId + identifiers
- quiltId + tag
- quiltPatchIds
- quiltId only
```

**Cause:** An invalid combination of query options was provided to `read-quilt` or `list-patches-in-quilt`.

**Solution:** Use exactly one of the valid query patterns:

- `--quilt-id` with `--identifiers`
- `--quilt-id` with `--tag`
- `--quilt-patch-ids` alone
- `--quilt-id` alone

#### `unrecognised trace exporter VALUE`

**Cause:** An invalid value was provided for the `--trace-cli` flag.

**Solution:** Use either `--trace-cli otlp` or `--trace-cli file=/path/to/file`.

#### `The object ID of an exchange object must be specified`

**Cause:** The `get-wal` command requires an exchange object ID, but none was provided. This command is only available on Testnet.

**Solution:** Specify the exchange object ID:

```
$ walrus get-wal --exchange-id EXCHANGE_OBJECT_ID
```

#### `operation cancelled by user`

**Cause:** You declined a confirmation prompt, for example the upload relay tip confirmation.

**Solution:** Re-run the command and confirm when prompted, or use `--skip-tip-confirmation` for upload relay to bypass the prompt.

## Blob ID errors

Errors in this section occur when a blob ID is missing, malformed, or refers to a blob that is unavailable.

#### `you seem to be using a numeric value in decimal format corresponding to a Walrus blob ID`

**Cause:** A decimal blob ID (often copied from a Sui explorer) was provided instead of the URL-safe base64 format that Walrus uses.

**Solution:** The error message includes the correct blob ID. You can also convert it manually:

```
$ walrus convert-blob-id DECIMAL_VALUE
```

:::info
Some on-chain representations and Sui explorers display blob IDs as large decimal numbers. These are not valid blob IDs for Walrus API calls. Always convert them to URL-safe base64 format before use.
:::

#### `the provided blob ID is invalid`

**Cause:** The provided blob ID string cannot be parsed as either a base64-encoded blob ID or a decimal value.

**Solution:** Verify the blob ID is correct and is in URL-safe base64 format (43 characters). If you copied it from a Sui explorer, convert it with `walrus convert-blob-id`.

#### Blob not found

**Error:**

```
Error: Blob not found on Sui
HTTP 404: Blob ID not registered
```

**Cause:** The blob was never uploaded, has expired (past its storage epoch), belongs to a different network, or was marked invalid on-chain.

**Solution:** Verify the blob ID is correct and that you are querying the correct network. Check the blob status:

```
$ walrus blob-status --blob-id BLOB_ID
```

If the blob expired, re-upload it. On Mainnet, each storage epoch is approximately 14 days. The maximum storage duration is 53 epochs.

#### `the blob has not been registered or has already expired`

**Cause:** It's possible to get this error when uploading for a single epoch right before an epoch change, or several storage nodes are lagging behind in processing network events during periods of heavy uploads.

**Solution:**

Retry the upload. If the error persists during high network activity, wait a few minutes and try again. Storage nodes might need time to process recent events.

## Insufficient funds

#### `Insufficient SUI for gas` or `Insufficient WAL for storage fees`

**Error (variants):**

```
Error: could not find SUI coins with sufficient balance [requested_amount=Some(1000000000)]
Error: could not find WAL coins with sufficient balance
ClientError { kind: NoCompatiblePaymentCoin }
```

**Cause:** Your wallet does not have enough SUI for gas fees or enough WAL for storage payments.

**Solution:** Check your wallet balance:

```
$ sui client gas
```

Add SUI or WAL to your wallet as needed. Use `walrus info` to check current storage costs per epoch. If you are using a publisher daemon, verify that the daemon wallet has sufficient funds for both SUI gas and WAL storage payments.

#### `there is enough balance to cover the requested amount but cannot be achieved with less than the maximum number of coins allowed`

**Cause:** Your balance is sufficient but spread across too many coin objects.

**Solution:** Merge your coins in the wallet and retry the operation.

## Transaction errors

#### Transaction timeout

**Error:**

```
Error: Transaction not confirmed within timeout
Warning: Transaction pending...
Error: RPC timeout waiting for transaction
```

**Cause:** Network congestion on Sui, RPC node issues, or the transaction is stuck in the mempool.

**Solution:** Check whether the transaction succeeded on-chain before retrying:

```
$ sui client tx-block TRANSACTION_ID
```

If the transaction succeeded, proceed normally. If it failed or was not found, retry the operation.

:::caution
Do not assume a timed-out transaction failed. Always check the on-chain state first. Retrying a successful transaction can result in duplicate blob registrations and wasted funds.
:::

#### Transaction conflict

**Error:**

```
Error: Transaction rejected: Invalid nonce
Error: Conflicting transaction
```

**Cause:** Multiple transactions from the same wallet were submitted simultaneously, or the wallet state is out of sync with the network.

**Solution:** Serialize transactions from the same wallet. Wait for each transaction to confirm before submitting the next one. If you are using a publisher, it should queue transactions internally to avoid conflicts.

---

## Connectivity errors

Errors in this section occur when a client, publisher, or aggregator cannot reach other components in the network.

#### Client cannot reach a publisher or aggregator

**Error:**

```
Error: Connection timeout
Error: Connection refused
Error: DNS resolution failed
```

**Cause:** The publisher or aggregator is down, a firewall is blocking the connection, or DNS is misconfigured.

**Solution:** Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in your application. If multiple publishers or aggregators are available, try an alternative endpoint. Set reasonable timeouts: 30 seconds for uploads and 10 seconds for reads.

See [Error Handling](/docs/troubleshooting/error-handling) for an example of retry logic in the TypeScript SDK.

#### Publisher cannot reach storage nodes

**Error:**

```
Error: Failed to distribute slivers
Warning: Storage node X unreachable
Error: Quorum not reached (received 1/2 of signatures)
```

**Cause:** One or more storage nodes are offline, overloaded, or unreachable due to a network partition.

**Solution:** Retry the upload. The publisher might reach different nodes on subsequent attempts. If 2/3 of storage nodes respond, the upload succeeds. If fewer than 2/3 respond, the upload fails. Check on-chain state to verify whether the blob was registered, then retry if necessary.

#### Aggregator cannot fetch enough slivers

**Error:**

```
Error: Failed to fetch slivers
Warning: Storage node Y unreachable
Error: Insufficient slivers
```

**Cause:** Most likely the aggregator is misconfigured.

**Solution:** Retry the read request. Only 1/3 of primary slivers are needed to reconstruct a blob, so the system tolerates many nodes being offline. Try a different aggregator if available, or wait and retry.

---

## Storage node errors

Errors in this section relate to storage node data integrity.

#### Sliver not found

**Error:**

```
Error: Sliver not found on storage node
HTTP 404: Sliver ID not in database
```

**Cause:** The blob expired or was never stored.

**Solution:** Retry the read. Other nodes hold copies of the slivers through erasure coding. If fewer than 1/3 of nodes lost data, retrieval succeeds normally. If the error persists, check the on-chain blob status with `walrus blob-status`. Re-upload the blob if necessary.

#### Sliver hash mismatch

**Error:**

```
Error: Sliver hash mismatch
Error: Consistency check failed
```

**Cause:** Disk or memory corruption on the storage node, a Byzantine (malicious) node, or a network transmission error.

**Solution:** The aggregator automatically detects hash mismatches through Merkle tree verification and fetches replacement slivers from other nodes. No client-side action is required unless the error persists, in which case you can run a strict consistency check:

```
$ walrus read BLOB_ID --strict-consistency-check
```

#### Invalid signature from a storage node

**Error:**

```
Warning: Node X returned invalid signature
Error: Certificate verification failed
```

**Cause:** A compromised or malicious storage node, or a software bug in the node implementation.

**Solution:** The system handles this automatically. Walrus provides Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and functions correctly with up to 1/3 of nodes behaving maliciously. No client-side action is required.

## Encoding errors

#### Out of memory during encoding

**Error:**

```
Error: Out of memory
Error: Failed to allocate encoding buffer
```

**Cause:** The blob is too large for available memory. The encoding needs at least 4.5x the blob size if the blob is to be stored. If the blob is only encoded to compute the metadata or blob ID, it's only ~1.5x.

**Solution:** Run the CLI on a machine with sufficient RAM. Split large blobs into smaller chunks in your application before uploading. If you are using a publisher, use one with more available memory.
