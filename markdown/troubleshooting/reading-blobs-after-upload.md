Walrus itself is strongly consistent. Once a blob is certified, any aggregator reading directly from storage nodes returns it immediately. Public aggregators often sit behind a content delivery network (CDN), which might cache a `404 Not Found` response from before the aggregator sees the blob.

If your app reads blobs through a cached aggregator immediately after upload, plan for this short window.

## When this applies

This propagation window only affects you when both conditions are true:

- You read through a public aggregator with a CDN in front, such as the Mainnet or Testnet public aggregators.
- You read a blob within seconds of its certification.

The window does not apply in these cases:

- You read from a self-hosted aggregator with no CDN in front. Reads are strongly consistent.
- The blob does not exist. A `404` in that case is correct and should not be retried.

## Retry only when you know the blob should exist

Because Walrus is strongly consistent, a `404` from an uncached aggregator means the blob is not on the network. Retrying every `404` adds latency for missing blobs.

Retry with backoff only when your app knows the blob has just been certified. Treat other `404` responses as final.

## Example: retry after a known upload

The following helper is for the post-upload path: your app receives a successful certification, then immediately fetches the blob through a cached aggregator. It surfaces non-404 errors immediately and only retries `404`.

async function fetchBlobWithRetry(
  blobId: string,
  aggregatorUrl: string,
  opts = { maxAttempts: 6, baseDelayMs: 500 },
): Promise<ArrayBuffer> {
  let lastError: unknown;
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < opts.maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      const res = await fetch(`${aggregatorUrl}/v1/blobs/${blobId}`, { cache: "no-store" });
      if (res.ok) return await res.arrayBuffer();
      if (res.status !== 404) throw new Error(`Unexpected status ${res.status}`);
    } catch (err) {
      lastError = err;
    }
    const delay = opts.baseDelayMs * 2 ** attempt;
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, delay));
  }
  throw lastError ?? new Error(`Blob ${blobId} not available after ${opts.maxAttempts} attempts`);
}
```

Tune `maxAttempts` and `baseDelayMs` to your latency budget. A few seconds of total retry time is usually sufficient. Do not use this pattern for general reads. For those reads, treat `404` as final.

#### Bypass the CDN cache if needed

Some CDNs might ignore cache control headers and cache the `404` response. If retries keep returning the cached `404`, append a unique query parameter:

```ts
fetch(`${aggregatorUrl}/v1/blobs/${blobId}?cb=${Date.now()}`);
```

Once the blob is reliably reachable, you can remove the query parameter.

#### Use multiple aggregators

If a single aggregator is slow to surface the blob, try another aggregator. If one aggregator returns `404` but another returns the blob, the blob is on the network.

#### Pre-warm the read path before demos

Before showing a freshly uploaded blob to an audience, retrieve it once from the aggregator you plan to use. This populates the aggregator and CDN caches before you need them.
