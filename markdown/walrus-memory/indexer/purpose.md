The indexer keeps the backend in sync with onchain state so the relayer can resolve accounts quickly.

## Why it exists

Without the indexer, every authenticated request would require the relayer to scan the onchain `AccountRegistry` to find which `MemWalAccount` holds a given delegate key. This involves fetching the registry object, iterating through its dynamic fields, and checking each account, an expensive chain of RPC calls.

The indexer eliminates this by listening to Sui events and syncing account data into PostgreSQL. The relayer can then resolve delegate key ownership with a single database lookup.

## How it works

The indexer is a standalone Rust service (`services/indexer`) that:

1. Connects to the same PostgreSQL database as the relayer
2. Polls Sui blockchain events using `suix_queryEvents`
3. Filters for `AccountCreated` events from the Walrus Memory package
4. Inserts `account_id → owner` mappings into the `accounts` table
5. Stores its event cursor in `indexer_state` so it can resume after restarts

## Auth resolution flow

When the relayer receives a request, it resolves the delegate key's account using this priority:

1. **PostgreSQL cache** (`delegate_key_cache`), fastest, populated lazily by the relayer itself
2. **Indexed accounts** (`accounts`), populated by the indexer, enables account discovery without chain scans
3. **Onchain registry scan**, fallback, scans `AccountRegistry` dynamic fields through RPC
4. **Header hint** (`x-account-id`), client-provided hint, useful during first-time setup
5. **Config fallback** (`MEMWAL_ACCOUNT_ID`), server-level default

After successful resolution through any strategy, the mapping is cached in `delegate_key_cache` for future requests.

## Configuration

The indexer reads these environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `MEMWAL_PACKAGE_ID` | Yes | | Walrus Memory contract package ID to filter events |
| `SUI_RPC_URL` | No | Mainnet fullnode | Sui RPC endpoint |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_SECS` | No | `5` | Seconds between event poll cycles |

## Running

```bash
$ cd services/indexer
$ cargo run
```

The indexer is recommended for production but optional for development, the relayer can fall back to onchain resolution without it.
