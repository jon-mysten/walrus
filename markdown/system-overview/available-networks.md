Walrus Mainnet operates a production-quality storage network using corresponding resources on the Sui Mainnet. The Walrus Testnet operates in conjunction with the Sui Testnet and is used to test new features of Walrus before they graduate to the Mainnet. Developers can operate a local instance of both Walrus and Sui for testing.

## Network parameters

Important fixed system parameters for Mainnet and Testnet are summarized in the following table:

| Parameter                                                | Mainnet | Testnet |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Sui network                                              | Mainnet | Testnet |
| Number of shards                                         | 1000    | 1000    |
| Epoch duration                                           | 2 weeks | 1 day   |
| Maximum number of epochs for which storage can be bought | 53      | 53      |

Many other parameters, including the system capacity and prices, are dynamic. Such parameters are stored in the [system object](/docs/system-overview/core-concepts#system-and-staking-information) and can be viewed with tools like the [Walruscan explorer](https://walruscan.com/).

## Mainnet configuration

The client parameters for the Walrus Mainnet are:

In case you wish to explore the Walrus contracts, their package IDs are:

- WAL package: `0x356a26eb9e012a68958082340d4c4116e7f55615cf27affcff209cf0ae544f59`

- Walrus package: `0xfdc88f7d7cf30afab2f82e8380d11ee8f70efb90e863d1de8616fae1bb09ea77`

As these are inferred automatically from the object IDs above, there is no need to manually input them into the Walrus client configuration file. The latest published package IDs can also be found in the `Move.lock` files in the subdirectories of the [`contracts` directory on GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/contracts).

The configuration file described on the [setup page](/docs/getting-started) includes both Mainnet and Testnet configuration.

## Testnet configuration

All transactions are executed on the Sui Testnet and use Testnet WAL and SUI which have no value. The state of the network can and will be wiped at any point and possibly with no warning. Do not rely on this Testnet for any production purposes, as it comes with no availability or persistence guarantees.

New features on Testnet might break deployed Testnet apps, since this is the network in which new updates are tested for compatibility with eco-system applications.

Also see the [Testnet terms of service](/docs/legal/testnet_tos) under which this Testnet is made available.

### Testnet parameters

The configuration parameters for the Walrus Testnet are included in the configuration file described on the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started#step-2-configure-tooling-for-walrus-testnet). If you want only the Testnet configuration, you can get the Testnet-only configuration file. The parameters are:

The current Testnet package IDs can be found in the `Move.lock` files in the subdirectories of the [`testnet-contracts` directory on GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/testnet-contracts).

### Testnet WAL faucet

The Walrus Testnet uses Testnet WAL tokens for buying storage and staking. Testnet WAL tokens have no value and can be exchanged at a 1:1 rate for some Testnet SUI tokens, which also have no value, through the following command:

```sh
$ walrus get-wal
```

You can check that you have received Testnet WAL by checking the Sui balances:

```sh
$ sui client balance
```

If successful, the console responds:

```sh
╭─────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Balance of coins owned by this address  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ╭─────────────────────────────────────╮ │
│ │ coin  balance (raw)     balance     │ │
│ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │
│ │ Sui   8869252670        8.86 SUI    │ │
│ │ WAL   500000000         0.50 WAL    │ │
│ ╰─────────────────────────────────────╯ │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

By default, 0.5 SUI are exchanged for 0.5 WAL, but a different amount of SUI can be exchanged using the `--amount` option, the value is in MIST/FROST, and a specific SUI/WAL exchange object can be used through the `--exchange-id` option. The `walrus get-wal --help` command provides more information about those.

## Run a local Walrus network

In addition to publicly deployed Walrus networks, you can deploy a Walrus network on your local machine for local testing. Run the script `scripts/local-testbed.sh` found in the [Walrus GitHub repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus). See `scripts/local-testbed.sh -h` for further usage information.

The script generates configuration that you can use when [running the Walrus client](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs) and prints the path to that configuration file.

You can also spin up a local Grafana instance to visualize the metrics collected by the storage nodes. This can be done through `cd docker/grafana-local; docker compose up`. This should work with the default storage node configuration.

While the Walrus storage nodes of this local network run on your local machine, the Sui Devnet is used by default to deploy and interact with the contracts. To run the local network fully locally, simply [start a local network with `sui start --with-faucet --force-regenesis`](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/sui-101/local-network) (requires `sui` to be `v1.28.0` or higher) and specify `localnet` when starting the Walrus testbed.
