The Walrus client offers a daemon mode that runs a simple web server that provides HTTP interfaces you can use to store and read blobs in an [aggregator](/docs/operator-guide/aggregator) or [publisher](/docs/operator-guide/aggregator) role respectively. Walrus also offers HTTP APIs through [public aggregator and publisher services](#public-services) that you can use without running a local client. 

Walrus aggregators and publishers expose their API specifications at the path `/v1/api`. View this path in a browser, for example, at https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/api. The latest version of these specifications is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/crates/walrus-service) in HTML and YAML format.

## Using a public aggregator or publisher {#public-services}

On Walrus Testnet, many entities run public aggregators and publishers. On Mainnet, there are no public publishers without authentication, as they consume both SUI and WAL.

See the [aggregators and publishers list](#agg-list) for public services on Mainnet and Testnet. Walrus also provides the [operator lists in JSON format](pathname:///operators.json).

The operator list in JSON format includes additional info about aggregators, namely whether they are deployed with caching functionality and whether they are found to be functional. The list is updated once per week.

Most aggregators and publishers limit requests to 10 MB by default. If you want to upload larger files, you need to [run your own publisher](/docs/operator-guide/aggregator#local-daemon) or use the [CLI](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs).
