The `headers` section allows you to specify custom HTTP response headers for specific resources. The keys in the `headers` object are the paths of the resources, and the values are lists of key-value pairs corresponding to the headers that the portal attaches to the response.

In the example, the file `index.html` is served with the `Content-Type` header set to `text/html; charset=utf-8` and the `Cache-Control` header set to `max-age=3500`. The resource path is always represented as starting from the root `/`.

This mechanism allows you to control various aspects of the resource delivery, such as caching, encoding, and content types.

### Default headers

By default, no headers need to be specified, and the `ws-resources.json` file can be omitted. The `site-builder` automatically tries to infer the `Content-Type` header based on the file extension, and set the `Content-Encoding` to `identity` (no transformation).

In case the content type cannot be inferred, the `Content-Type` is set to `application/octet-stream`. These defaults are overridden by any headers specified in the `ws-resources.json` file.
