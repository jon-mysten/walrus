The `metadata` section of [`ws-resources.json`](/docs/sites/configuration/site-configuration) lets you add human-readable information to your Walrus Site object. This data is stored on-chain and is used by portals, explorers, wallets, and other tools to display information about your site.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "link": "https://myproject.wal.app",
    "image_url": "https://myproject.wal.app/preview.png",
    "description": "A decentralized app built on Sui and Walrus.",
    "project_url": "https://github.com/myorg/myproject",
    "creator": "MyOrg"
  }
}
```

The five fields correspond to the basic set of properties suggested by the [Sui Object Display standard](https://docs.sui.io/standards/display#display-properties).

**All fields are optional.** You may include any combination of them, or omit the `metadata` block entirely.

## Metadata fields

### `link`

**Type:** `string` (URL)  
**Purpose:** The canonical public URL of your Walrus Site.

This is the URL through which users will access your site. It is used by portals and social preview tools as the primary link to represent the site.

**Example:** SuiNS subdomain

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "link": "https://myapp.wal.app"
  }
}
```

**Example:** Custom domain

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "link": "https://www.myproject.xyz"
  }
}
```

**Example:** Testnet portal

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "link": "https://2ffmxm7jmglccr79htmpdbaeqezp2krgftue5pfq9f83tdqjsc.localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

### `image_url`

**Type:** `string` (URL)  
**Purpose:** A URL pointing to a preview image for the site.

This image is used as the thumbnail when your site is shared or listed in explorers and marketplaces. It should be a publicly accessible image hosted on a stable URL.

**Example:** Image hosted on the same Walrus site

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "image_url": "https://myapp.wal.app/og-image.png"
  }
}
```

**Example:** Image hosted on an external CDN

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "image_url": "https://cdn.myproject.xyz/preview/walrus-site-banner.jpg"
  }
}
```

**Example:** Image hosted on Walrus directly

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "image_url": "https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/blobs/abc123xyz"
  }
}
```

### `description`

**Type:** `string`  
**Purpose:** A short human-readable description of the site.

This appears in Sui explorers, portal listings, and social sharing previews, similar to the `<meta name="description">` HTML meta tag. You can use `description` to provide a one or two sentence summary of what your site is and does.

**Example:** A simple app

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "description": "A decentralized token swap interface built on Sui."
  }
}
```

**Example:** An NFT project

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Flatland NFTs — mint and collect unique generative art stored entirely on Walrus."
  }
}
```

**Example:** A developer tool

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "description": "An open-source block explorer for the Sui testnet with real-time transaction search."
  }
}
```

### `project_url`

**Type:** `string` (URL)  
**Purpose:** A URL pointing to the project's source code, homepage, or documentation.

This is intended to provide a link to where users and developers can learn more about the project behind the site, such as a GitHub repository, a documentation site, or a marketing page. It is separate from `link`, which represents the site itself.

**Example:** A GitHub repository

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "project_url": "https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites"
  }
}
```

**Example:** A documentation site

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "project_url": "https://docs.myproject.xyz"
  }
}
```

**Example:** An external landing page

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "project_url": "https://www.myorg.io"
  }
}
```

### `creator`

**Type:** `string`  
**Purpose:** Identifies the author or organization that created and deployed the site.

This is a `string` shown in explorers and directory listings to indicate ownership or attribution. It can be an individual name, a team, an organization, or a handle.

**Example:** Individual

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "creator": "Alice"
  }
}
```

**Example:** Organization

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "creator": "MystenLabs"
  }
}
```

**Example:** Handle or alias

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "creator": "@walrus_builder"
  }
}
```
