When you deploy your own Walrus Sites portal, you might expose the same site under multiple hostnames:

- **A [SuiNS](https://suins.io/) domain**: A human-readable names registered on-chain, for example `snowreads.wal.app`.

- **Base36**: Subdomains derived directly from the site object ID, for example `1myb…xd.portal.com`.

- **[Custom domains](/docs/sites/custom-domains/bringing-your-own-domain)**: Your own domain obtained by a third-party service, for example `example.com`.

Search engines treat the same content served at multiple hosts as duplicates, which can dilute ranking signals.

The official [`wal.app`](https://wal.app) portal avoids this issue by only serving SuiNS domains, with base36 and custom domains disabled. If you run your own portal and enable base36 or a custom domain, you must take steps to signal a canonical host.

These steps do not require any changes to the Walrus Sites portal itself but rather are site-level fixes applied as HTML tags or HTTP headers that you can add when hosting your own portal.

## Example

You run a site that is reachable at both `https://example.wal.app/math` (SuiNS) and `https://example.com/math` (custom domain). A web crawler sees identical content at 2 different URLs and might treat them as duplicates.

To solve this, add a canonical hint in the HTML `<head>` so crawlers know which host to index:

```html

```

## Recommended practices

**Canonical host policy:** Choose 1 hostname type per site. Custom domain > SuiNS > base36 is a good priority ranking. All other hosts should include canonical hints pointing to that choice.

**Base36 subdomains**: Disable if not needed: `B36_DOMAIN_RESOLUTION_SUPPORT=false`. If enabled, add canonical hints (`<link rel="canonical">` or `Link: rel="canonical"`). Optionally, block them from indexing with `X-Robots-Tag: noindex

**Custom domains**: Setting `BRING_YOUR_OWN_DOMAIN=true` makes the portal serve only your configured custom domain (single-site mode). Other domains, including SuiNS and base36, are not resolved by that portal. It's always a good practice to add canonical hints in your HTML or headers pointing to your chosen custom domain to avoid duplicate indexing across different hosts.

**Multiple SuiNS names → 1 site:** This can happen permissionlessly. If you own the extra names, add canonical hints in your site HTML to point to your preferred domain.
