The term portal is used to indicate any technology that is used to access and browse Walrus Sites. Currently, only a server-side portal is served at https://wal.app.

https://wal.app only serves sites deployed on mainnet, linked with SuiNS names. You can run a portal to access Mainnet sites as well. Walrus Foundation does not maintain a portal that serves Testnet Walrus Sites. To access sites deployed on Testnet you can either use a third party Testnet portal, self-host one, or run one locally.

## Known portals

A list of known portals is maintained. Portals can self-identify by opening a PR that adds an entry to `docs/book/portals/list.json`. The stable branch of Walrus Sites is `mainnet`.

The service-worker portal is no longer hosted, but you can still run it locally. Its code is available in the `walrus-sites` repository. For more information, see [running a local portal](#running-a-local-portal).

## Running a local portal

Running a portal locally can be useful, for example if you want to browse Walrus Sites without accessing external portals, or for development purposes.

Start by cloning the `walrus-sites` repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites.git
$ cd walrus-sites
```

Make sure you are on the stable branch:

```sh
$ git checkout mainnet
```

### Configuration

Portal configuration is managed through 2 key elements:

- Environment variables: Required for basic functionality.

- Constants file: Optional for advanced customization.

#### Environment variables

The environment variables are set in the `.env.local` file at the root of each portal directory. To just run a simple instance of a portal, you can use the environment variables specified in the `.env.<network>.example` file:

##### Mainnet server portal environment variables

```sh
$ cp ./portal/server/.env.mainnet.example ./portal/server/.env.local
```

##### Testnet server portal environment variables

```sh
$ cp ./portal/server/.env.testnet.example ./portal/server/.env.local
```

Likewise, if you want to run the service-worker portal, you can copy the `.env.<network>.example` file to `.env.local` in the `portal/worker` directory.

##### Mainnet service-worker portal environment variables

```sh
$ cp ./portal/worker/.env.mainnet.example ./portal/worker/.env.local
```

##### Testnet service-worker portal environment variables

```sh
$ cp ./portal/worker/.env.testnet.example ./portal/worker/.env.local
```

For a more detailed configuration, you can modify the `.env.local` files to suit your needs. As a reference, here are the definitions of the environment variables:

The server portal code contains additional functionality that can be enabled or disabled using environment variables. For example, you can enable or disable the blocklist feature by setting the `ENABLE_BLOCKLIST` variable to `true` or `false`. This can be helpful to manage the behavior of the portal. For example, if you host a publicly-accessible portal, you might want to avoid serving sites that are not published by you.

- `AGGREGATOR_URL`: The URL to a Walrus aggregator that fetches the site resources from Walrus.

- `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY`: Provide it if you want to enable [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) for your server analytics.

- `EDGE_CONFIG`: If you host your portal on Vercel, you can use the [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-config) to blocklist certain SuiNS subdomains or Base36 object IDs.

- `EDGE_CONFIG_ALLOWLIST`: Similar to blocklist, but allows certain subdomains to use the premium rpc url list.

- `ENABLE_ALLOWLIST`: Enable the allowlist feature.

- `ENABLE_BLOCKLIST`: Enable the blocklist feature.

- `ENABLE_SENTRY`: Enable Sentry error tracking.

- `ENABLE_VERCEL_WEB_ANALYTICS`: Enable Vercel web analytics.

- `LANDING_PAGE_OID_B36`: The Base36 object ID of the landing page Walrus Site. That is, the page you get when you visit `localhost:3000`.

- `PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME_LENGTH`: If you connect your portal with a domain name, specify the length of the domain name. For example, `example.com` has a length of 11.

- `PREMIUM_RPC_URL_LIST`: A list of RPC URLs that are used when a site belongs to the allowlist.

- `RPC_URL_LIST`: A list of RPC URLs that are used when a site does not belong to the allowlist.

- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`: If you enable Sentry error tracking, provide your Sentry authentication token.

- `SENTRY_DSN`: If you enable Sentry error tracking, provide your Sentry DSN.

- `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`: If you enable Sentry error tracking, provide the sample rate for traces.

- `SITE_PACKAGE`: The Walrus Site package ID. Depending on the network you are using, you have to specify the correct package ID.

- `SUINS_CLIENT_NETWORK`: The network of the SuiNS client.

- `B36_DOMAIN_RESOLUTION_SUPPORT`: Define if Base36 domain resolution is supported. Otherwise, the site is not served.

#### Constants

You can find the `constants.ts` file in the `portal/common/lib` directory. It holds key configuration parameters for the portal. Typically, you won't need to modify these, but if you do, these are the available parameters:

- `MAX_REDIRECT_DEPTH`: The number of [redirects](/docs/sites/linking/redirects) the portal follows before stopping.

- `SITE_NAMES`: Hard coded `name: objectID` mappings, to override the SuiNS names. For development only. Use this at your own risk as it might render some sites with legitimate SuiNS names unusable.

- `FALLBACK_PORTAL`: This is related only to the service-worker portal. The fallback portal should be a server-side portal that is used in cases where some browsers do not support service-workers.

### Deploying the portal

To run the portal locally you can either use a Docker container or a local development environment.

#### Docker

First, make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If it is not installed, follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```sh
$ docker --version
```

Then, build the Docker image with:

```sh
$ docker build -f portal/docker/server/Dockerfile -t server-portal . --build-arg ENABLE_SENTRY=false --no-cache
```

Finally, run the Docker container:

```sh
$ docker run --env-file ./portal/server/.env.local -p 3000:3000 server-portal
```

Browse the sites at `localhost:3000`.

#### Local development

This requires having the [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) tool installed:

Check if bun is installed with:

```sh
$ bun --version
```

If not installed, run the following command:

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
$ cd portal
$ bun install
```

To run a server-side portal:

```sh
$ bun run server
```

To run a service-worker portal:

```sh
$ bun build:worker
$ bun run worker
```

Find the server side portal served at `localhost:3000` the service worker portal at `localhost:8080`.
