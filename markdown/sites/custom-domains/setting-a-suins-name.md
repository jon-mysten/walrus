Browsing sites with Base36 subdomains, for example, `https://1lupgq2auevjruy7hs9z7tskqwjp5cc8c5ebhci4v57qyl4piy.wal.app`, is no longer possible using the `wal.app` portal. Base36 subdomains are still supported if you use a local server or an alternative portal. To browse walrus sites using the `wal.app` portal, [you must use SuiNS names instead](/docs/sites/custom-domains/setting-a-suins-name#get-a-suins-name).

SuiNS names are like DNS for Sui and are used to assign a human-readable name to a Walrus Site. To do so, you simply have to get a SuiNS name you like and point it to the object ID of the Walrus Site.

## Get a SuiNS name

Navigate to https://suins.io (Mainnet) or https://testnet.suins.io (Testnet) and buy a domain name with your wallet. At the moment, you can only select names that are composed of letters `a-z` and numbers `0-9`, but no special characters (for example, `-`).

## Map the SuiNS name to the Walrus Site

Now, you can set the SuiNS name to point to the address of your Walrus Site. To do so, go to the **Names You Own** section at [suins.io](https://suins.io/account/my-names) or [testnet.suins.io](https://testnet.suins.io/account/my-names) for Testnet, click on the three dot menu icon above the name you want to map, and click **Link To Walrus Site**. Paste in the bar the object ID of the Walrus Site, check that it is correct, and click **Apply**.

After approving the transaction, you can now browse your site at https://your-domain.wal.app.
