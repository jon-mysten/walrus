There might be cases where you want to host a Walrus Site under a specific domain without following the default naming convention of `https://<walrus-site-domain>.<portal-domain>`.

For example, you might want to use a domain like `https://example.com` instead of `https://example.wal.app`, where `example.com` is a classic DNS domain that you can purchase from any domain registrar. It points to the IP and port of your portal.

You need follow the steps to configure your portal so that it only accepts requests for your own site, and other subdomains (other Walrus Sites) are not served:

1. [Deploy a local portal](/docs/sites/portals/deploy-locally) and include these additional environment variables to your `.env.local`:

```sh
$ LANDING_PAGE_OID_B36=34kgqayivjvwuwtk6lckk792g4qhpnimt58eol8i0b2tdgb0y # Example b36 ID
$ BRING_YOUR_OWN_DOMAIN=true
```

The `LANDING_PAGE_OID_B36`, should be the base36 object ID of your Walrus Site and `BRING_YOUR_OWN_DOMAIN` should be set to true to ensure the portal only serves your domain and no other sites. For example, `https://<some-site>.example.com` should throw a 404 error.

1. Configure your DNS provider to point your domain to the IP and port of your portal.
