After [setting up your portal and configuring it for your domain](/docs/sites/custom-domains/bringing-your-own-domain), you need to configure your domain's DNS to route traffic to the server running your portal.

This guide covers adding DNS records, setting up HTTPS with a reverse proxy, verifying propagation, and troubleshooting common DNS issues.

- [x] A portal running on a server with a public IP address, configured per [Use Your Own Domain for a Walrus Site](./bringing-your-own-domain)
- [x] Access to your domain's DNS settings through your domain registrar or DNS provider
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Point your root domain to the portal

Log in to your domain registrar or DNS provider and add an A record for your domain:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| A | `@` | Your server's public IP address |

The `@` symbol represents the root domain (for example, `example.com`). Replace the value with the actual public IP address of the server running your portal.

DNS changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours to propagate globally, depending on your DNS provider and the TTL (time to live) setting on your records. Most modern DNS providers propagate changes within a few minutes.

## Point a subdomain to the portal (optional)

If you want to serve your site at a subdomain like `www.example.com` or `app.example.com`, add an A record for the subdomain instead:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| A | `www` | Your server's public IP address |

You can add both a root domain record and a subdomain record, then configure your reverse proxy to handle both hostnames.

:::tip
Some domain registrars let you set up automatic redirects from `www` to your root domain (or the reverse). Check your registrar's documentation for redirect or forwarding options if you want both `example.com` and `www.example.com` to reach your site without running 2 separate server configurations.

## Set up HTTPS with a reverse proxy
 
:::info

The Walrus Sites repo provides 2 first-party deployment options for the portal server: a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites/blob/main/portal/docker/server/Dockerfile) for self-hosted deployments and a [`vercel.json`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites/blob/main/portal/server/vercel.json) for deploying on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which handles TLS automatically. If either of those fits your setup, you do not need a reverse proxy.

:::
 
If you are running the portal directly on a Linux server, it listens on port 3000 with no built-in TLS. To serve HTTPS traffic you need a reverse proxy in front of it. A reverse proxy like [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) or [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/) sits in front of your portal, handles TLS termination, and forwards requests to the portal process on its local port.
 
The following is a general-purpose [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) configuration that proxies HTTPS traffic to a portal running on port 3000. This is not an officially supported Walrus Sites configuration — adapt it to your environment:
 
```nginx title='nginx.conf'
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;
 
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
 
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
 
Replace `example.com` with your domain and adjust the port if your portal is configured differently.
 
Any standard TLS certificate works here. [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a common free option that automates certificate issuance and renewal:
 
```sh
$ certbot --nginx -d example.com
```
 
Certbot edits your Nginx config to reference the certificate and configures automatic renewal. [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https) is an alternative that handles TLS automatically without a separate certificate step.

## Verify DNS propagation

After adding your DNS records, confirm that your domain resolves to the correct IP address before testing the site.

##### Step 1: Check the A record

Use `dig` to confirm your domain resolves to your server's public IP address:

```sh
$ dig example.com A +short
```

The output should show your server's public IP address. If it returns nothing or a different address, the record has not yet propagated or was not saved correctly.

##### Step 2: Check that the portal is serving your site

Open a browser and navigate to your domain. Your Walrus Site should load. If the site does not load, check the following:

- The portal server is running on your server.
- The port the portal listens on is open in your server's firewall or security group.
- The reverse proxy (if used) is running and pointing to the correct port.
- The `portal-config.yaml` fields are set correctly, especially `landing_page_oid_b36` and `bring_your_own_domain: true`.
