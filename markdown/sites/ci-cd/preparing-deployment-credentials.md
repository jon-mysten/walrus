To deploy a Walrus Site through a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow, the workflow must sign [Sui transactions](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/transactions/txn-overview) on your behalf. This requires 2 credentials: a private key stored as an encrypted GitHub secret, and the corresponding Sui address stored as a GitHub variable.

- [x] [Install the Sui binary](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install).

## Exporting your private key

Use a separate Sui address for each GitHub workflow rather than sharing one address across multiple projects. A dedicated address provides 2 key benefits:

- **Security isolation:** A compromise of one workflow does not expose keys used elsewhere.
- **No equivocation:** When multiple concurrent workflow runs share an address, they compete for the same gas coins. Sui rejects duplicate coin references in the same checkpoint, causing transaction failures. A dedicated address eliminates this risk. See [Avoiding Equivocation](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/sui-101/avoid-equivocation) for details.

The Sui CLI stores all local keys in `~/.sui/sui_config/sui.keystore` as a JSON array of Base64-encoded strings. You can use an existing key from this file or generate a new one.

To use an existing key, run the following command to look up the Sui address that corresponds to a key in your keystore:

```sh
$ sui keytool unpack "<base64-key-from-sui.keystore>"
```

To generate a new key, run the following command to generate a new key pair:

```sh
$ sui keytool generate ed25519
```

You can substitute `ed25519` with `secp256k1` or `secp256r1` depending on your preferred signature scheme.

The command creates a file in your current directory named after the new Sui address, for example `0x123...abc.key`. The filename is your [Sui address](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/get-address). Copy the filename, you need it later for the `SUI_ADDRESS` variable.

Open the `.key` file. Its content is the private key in `base64WithFlag` format. This value is what you use for the `SUI_KEYSTORE` secret.

Use this method if you manage keys through the [Slush browser extension](https://slush.app/).

1. Open Slush and select the account you want to use for deployments. Copy its Sui address,you need it later for the `SUI_ADDRESS` variable.
2. Navigate to the account management screen and select **Export Private Key**.
3. Copy the private key displayed. It is in bech32 format and starts with `suiprivkey`.
4. Convert the bech32 key to the Base64 format required by the GitHub Action. Replace `suiprivkey...` with your copied key:

```sh
$ sui keytool convert suiprivkey...
```

5. The command produces a table similar to the following:

```sh
╭────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ bech32WithFlag │  suiprivkey............................................................  │
│ base64WithFlag │  A...........................................                            │
│ hexWithoutFlag │  ................................................................        │
│ scheme         │  ed25519                                                                 │
╰────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Copy the value in the `base64WithFlag` row. This is what you use for the `SUI_KEYSTORE` secret.

## Funding your deployment address

Before any workflow can deploy a site, the address needs SUI tokens to pay network gas fees and WAL tokens to pay for storage. For instructions on acquiring both, refer to [Getting Started with Walrus](/docs/getting-started).

## Adding credentials to GitHub

With your key and address ready, store them in your GitHub repository. The private key goes into an encrypted secret; the public address goes into a plain variable.

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository and click the **Settings** tab.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables**, then select **Actions**.
3. Open the **Secrets** tab and click **New repository secret**.
4. Set the name to `SUI_KEYSTORE`.
5. In the **Value** field, paste your `base64WithFlag` key wrapped as a JSON array:

```json
["AXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"]
```

> **Caution**
>
> The value must be a JSON array containing a single string element. Include the square brackets and quotation marks exactly as shown. A raw key string without the array wrapper causes authentication to fail.
6. Click **Add secret**.
7. Switch to the **Variables** tab and click **New repository variable**.
8. Set the name to `SUI_ADDRESS`.
9. In the **Value** field, paste the Sui address that corresponds to your private key, for example `0x123abc...def789`.
10. Click **Add variable**.

> **Danger**
>
> Never commit your private key to version control or share it in plain text. GitHub secrets are encrypted at rest and are only exposed to authorized workflow runs. Verify you are on the correct repository before saving.
## Next steps
 
With your credentials stored, you are ready to write the workflow file that uses them. See [Creating a GitHub Actions Workflow for Walrus Sites](/docs/sites/ci-cd/github-actions-workflow) for complete workflow examples and a reference of all action inputs.
