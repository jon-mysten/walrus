This page covers advanced setup options for Walrus, including building from source, installing from binaries, or using Cargo. For standard setup instructions, see the Walrus [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide.

Walrus is open source under an Apache 2 license. You can download and install it through [`suiup`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup) on GitHub, or you can build and install it from the Rust source code through Cargo.

## Walrus binaries

The `walrus` client binary is currently provided for macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs), Ubuntu, and Windows. The Ubuntu version most likely works on other Linux distributions as well.

:::tip

Our latest Walrus binaries are also available on Walrus itself, namely on https://bin.wal.app, for example, https://bin.wal.app/walrus-mainnet-latest-ubuntu-x86_64. Because of DoS protection, it might not be possible to download the binaries with `curl` or `wget`.

:::

## Install through script {#nix-install}

To download and install `walrus` to your `"$HOME"/.local/bin directory`, run 1 of the following commands in your terminal then follow on-screen instructions. If you are on Windows, see the Windows-specific instructions or the [`suiup` installation](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup) on GitHub.

```bash
# Run a first-time install using the latest Mainnet version.
$ curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh

# Install the latest Testnet version instead.
$ curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh -s -- -n testnet

# Update an existing installation (overwrites prior version of walrus).
$ curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh -s -- -f
```

Make sure that the `"$HOME"/.local/bin` directory is in your `$PATH`.

After this is done, you can run Walrus by using the `walrus` command in your terminal.

```console
$ walrus --help
```

## Install on Windows {#windows-install}

To download `walrus` to your Microsoft Windows computer, run the following in a PowerShell.

```PowerShell
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/walrus-testnet-latest-windows-x86_64.exe",
  "walrus.exe"
)
```

From there, place `walrus.exe` somewhere in your `PATH`.

:::info

Most of the remaining instructions assume a UNIX-based system for the directory structure, commands, and so on. If you use Windows, you might need to adapt most of those.

:::

## Use GitHub releases

You can find all the releases including release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/releases). Download the archive for your system and extract the `walrus` binary.

## Install through Cargo

You can also install Walrus through Cargo. For example, to install the latest Mainnet version:

```sh
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus --branch mainnet walrus-service --locked
```

In place of `--branch mainnet`, you can also specify specific tags (for example, `--tag mainnet-v1.18.2`) or commits (for example, `--rev b2009ac73388705f379ddad48515e1c1503fc8fc`).

## Build from source

Walrus is open source software published under the Apache 2 license. The code is developed in a `git` repository at https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus.

The latest version of Mainnet and Testnet are available under the branches `mainnet` and `testnet` respectively, and the latest version under the `main` branch. Reports of issues and bug fixes are welcome. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to build and use Walrus from source.

## Configure Walrus

:::tip

The easiest way to obtain the latest configuration is by downloading it directly from Walrus:

```sh
curl --create-dirs https://docs.wal.app/setup/client_config.yaml -o ~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml
```

:::

The Walrus client needs to know about the Sui objects that store the Walrus system and staking information, see the [developer guide](/docs/system-overview/core-concepts#system-and-staking-information). Configure these in a file at `~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml`.

You can access Testnet and Mainnet through the following configuration. This example Walrus CLI configuration refers to the standard location for Sui configuration (`"~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml"`).

### Use a custom path (optional) {#config-custom-path}

By default, the Walrus client looks for the `client_config.yaml` (or `client_config.yml`) configuration file in the current directory, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/walrus/`, `~/.config/walrus/`, or `~/.walrus/`. However, you can place the file anywhere and name it anything you like. In this case, use the `--config` option when running the `walrus` binary.

## Use advanced configuration (optional)

The configuration file currently supports the following parameters for each of the contexts:

```yaml
# These are the only mandatory fields. These objects are specific for a particular Walrus
# deployment but then do not change over time.
system_object: 0x2134d52768ea07e8c43570ef975eb3e4c27a39fa6396bef985b5abc58d03ddd2
staking_object: 0x10b9d30c28448939ce6c4d6c6e0ffce4a7f8a4ada8248bdad09ef8b70e4a3904

# You can specify a list of Sui RPC URLs for reads. If none is provided, the RPC URL in the Sui
# wallet is used.
rpc_urls:
  - https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443

# You can define a custom path to your Sui wallet configuration here. If this is unset or `null`
# (default), the wallet is configured from `./sui_config.yaml` (relative to your current working
# directory), or the system-wide wallet at `~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml` in this order. Both
# `active_env` and `active_address` can be omitted, in which case the values from the Sui wallet
# are used.
wallet_config:
  # The path to the wallet configuration file.
  path: ~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml
  # The optional `active_env` to use to override whatever `active_env` is listed in the
  # configuration file.
  active_env: mainnet
  # The optional `active_address` to use to override whatever `active_address` is listed in the
  # configuration file.
  active_address: 0x...

# [...]
```

There are some additional parameters that you can use to tune the networking behavior of the client. If you experience excessively slow uploads, it might be worth experimenting with these values. There is no risk in playing around with these values. In the worst case, you might not be able to store or read blob because of timeouts or other networking errors.
