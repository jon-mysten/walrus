Walrus is a platform for building efficient and resilient data markets, where data is stored as blobs. Walrus stores each blob as an immutable array of bytes, and you can store any type of file, such as text, video, or source code.

Sui is a blockchain that supports programmability at a [fundamental level](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks). Walrus binds all blobs to objects on the Sui blockchain.

## Walrus and Sui

Walrus depends on Sui, as it leverages Sui to track blobs, their respective owners, and their lifetimes.

Sui and Walrus are both decentralized, distributed systems made up of many independent servers that communicate and collectively establish shared state. A group of servers together is a network.

### Available networks

Sui and Walrus each have the following available [networks](/docs/system-overview/available-networks):

- **Testnet** is a sandbox-like network where you can receive test tokens for free to use for the network's fees. You can build, test, and debug software packages on Testnet. Testnet does not guarantee data persistence and might wipe data at any time without warning.
- **Mainnet** is a production environment where you use real tokens and users or other applications rely on consistent functionality.

When you are getting started, you should use **Testnet**.

##step Install tooling

To install Walrus and Sui, use the Mysten Labs `suiup` tool.

 [Install suiup](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup?tab=readme-ov-file#installation):
```sh
    $ curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mystenlabs/suiup/main/install.sh | sh
```

 Install `sui` and `walrus`:

```sh
    $ suiup install sui
    $ suiup install walrus
```

##step Configure tooling for Walrus Testnet

After installing Walrus it is important to configure the Walrus client, which tells it the RPC URLs to use to access Testnet or Mainnet, and the Sui objects that track the state of the Walrus network. The easiest way to configure Walrus is to download the following pre-filled configuration file.

Download the configuration file:

```sh
    $ curl --create-dirs https://docs.wal.app/setup/client_config.yaml -o ~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml
```

Configure the Sui client to connect to Testnet. 

The Sui client configuration is separate from the Walrus client configuration. [Learn more about the Sui client configuration.](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/configure-sui-client)

Initialize the Sui client:

```sh
    $ sui client
```

When prompted, enter the following:

    - Connect to a Sui Full Node server? → `Y`
    - Full node server URL → `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443`
    - Environment alias → `testnet`
    - Select key scheme → `0` (for ed25519)

    This creates your Sui client configuration file with a Testnet environment and generates your first address.

 To confirm the Walrus configuration also uses Testnet, run the command:

```sh
    $ walrus info
```

    Make sure that this command's output includes `Epoch duration: 1day` to indicate connection to Testnet.

For detailed information about the `walrus` command-line tool, use the `walrus --help` command. Or, append `--help` to any `walrus` subcommand to get details about that specific command.

##step Understanding your Sui account

When you ran `sui client` during setup, the system automatically created a Sui account for you. Sui uses addresses and accounts. When you store blobs on Walrus, Walrus binds them to an object on Sui that an address owns.

An address is a unique location on the blockchain. A 32-byte identifier (displayed as 64 hex characters with `0x` prefix) identifies the address, which can own objects. The system derives the address from a public key using a hash function.

Anyone can see addresses, and they are valid on all networks (Testnet, Mainnet, and so on), but networks do not share data and assets.

An account is an address plus the key to access it. If you have an address's private key, you have privileged access and control over what the address owns, such as tokens and objects.

To view your active address, run:

```sh
$ sui client active-address
```

To see all your addresses and their key schemes, run:

```sh
$ sui client addresses
```

:::warning Store your keys securely

You must store your private key and recovery passphrase securely, otherwise you might lose access to your address.

[Learn more about addresses, available key pair options, and key storage.](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/get-address)

:::

 Creating additional addresses (optional)

You can create additional addresses if needed:
```sh
$ sui client new-address ed25519
```

The argument `ed25519` specifies the key pair scheme to be of type `ed25519`.

##step Fund Sui account with tokens

Before you can upload a file to Walrus and store it as a blob, you need SUI tokens to pay transaction fees and WAL tokens to pay for storage on the network. The Walrus Testnet uses Testnet WAL tokens that have no value and you can exchange them at a 1:1 rate for Testnet SUI tokens.

 Navigate to the SUI Testnet faucet: [https://faucet.sui.io/](https://faucet.sui.io/)

 Ensure you select Testnet. 

Then, insert your Sui address. To print your Sui address, use the command:

```sh
    $ sui client active-address
```

 After you insert your address on the faucet and receive a message saying you have received SUI tokens, check your balance with the command:
```sh

    $ sui client balance
```

    :::tip Faucet alternatives

    The Sui faucet is rate limited. If you encounter errors or have questions, you can request tokens from the Discord faucet or a third party faucet. [Learn more about the Sui faucet.](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins)

    :::

 Convert some of those SUI tokens into WAL with the command:

```sh
    $ walrus get-wal --context testnet
```

 Check your balance again with `sui client balance` to confirm you now have WAL:

```sh
    ╭─────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ Balance of coins owned by this address  │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ ╭─────────────────────────────────────╮ │
    │ │ coin  balance (raw)     balance     │ │
    │ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │
    │ │ Sui        497664604      0.49 SUI  │ │
    │ │ WAL Token  500000000      0.50 WAL  │ │
    │ ╰─────────────────────────────────────╯ │
    ╰─────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

##step Store a blob

Changes to objects on Sui happen through the use of transactions. Accounts sign these transactions on behalf of addresses and they result in the system creating, updating, transferring, and sometimes destroying objects. Learn more about [transactions](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transactions).

To upload a file to Walrus and store it as a blob, run the following command:

```sh
$ walrus store file.txt --epochs 2 --context testnet
```

Replace `file.txt` with the file you want to store on Walrus. You can store any file type on Walrus.

You must specify the `--epochs` flag, as the system stores blobs for a certain number of epochs. An epoch is a certain period of time on the network. On Testnet, epochs are 1 day, and on Mainnet epochs are 2 weeks. You can extend the number of epochs the system stores a blob indefinitely.

The system uploads a blob in slivers, which are small pieces of the file the system stores on different servers through erasure coding. [Learn more](/docs/design/encoding) about the Walrus architecture and how the system implements erasure coding.

You can use the [Walrus Explorer](https://walruscan.com/) to view more information about a blob ID.

##step Retrieve a blob

To retrieve a blob and save it on your local machine, run the following command:

```sh
$ walrus read <blob-id> --out file.txt --context testnet
```

Replace `<blob-id>` with the blob's identifier the `walrus store` command returns in its output, and replace `file.txt` with the name and file extension for storing the file locally.

##step Extend a blob's storage duration

To extend a blob's storage duration, you must reference the Sui object ID and indicate how many epochs you want to extend the blob's storage for.

Run the following command to extend a blob's storage duration by 3 epochs. You must use the Sui object ID, not the blob ID:

```sh
$ walrus extend --blob-obj-id <blob-object-id> --epochs-extended 3 --context testnet
```

Replace `<blob-object-id>` with the blob's Sui object ID the `walrus store` command returns in its output.

##step Delete a blob

All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by anyone. The `delete` command does not delete blobs from caches, slivers from past storage nodes, or copies that could have been made by users before the blob was deleted.

To delete a blob, run the following command:

```sh
$ walrus delete --blob-id <blob-id> --context testnet
```

Replace `<blob-id>` with the blob's identifier the `walrus store` command returns in its output.
