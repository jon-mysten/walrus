## System overview

- [Available Networks](/system-overview/available-networks): Overview of Walrus networks including Mainnet and Testnet configurations, parameters, and setup instructions.
- [Components](/system-overview/components): From a developer perspective, some Walrus components are objects and smart contracts on Sui, and some components are Walrus-specific binaries and services. As a rule, Sui is used to manage blob and storage node metadata, while Walrus-specific services are used to store and read blob contents, which can be very large.
- [Core Concepts](/system-overview/core-concepts): Technical reference for Walrus Sui smart contracts including blob objects, storage resources, and system events for developers.
- [Operations](/system-overview/operations): Developer guide to Walrus operations including store, read, certify availability, and delete operations for blob management.
- [Public Aggregators and Publishers](/system-overview/public-aggregators-and-publishers): The Walrus client offers a daemon mode that runs a simple web server that provides HTTP interfaces you can use to store and read blobs in an aggregator or publisher role respectively. Walrus also offers HTTP APIs through public aggregator and publisher services that you can use without running a local client.

- [Sui Object IDs and Blob IDs](/system-overview/sui-object-and-blob-ids): The command walrus blob-id can be used to derive the blob ID of any file. The blob ID is a commitment to the file, and any blob with the same ID decodes to the same content. The blob ID is a 256 bit number and represented on some Sui explorers as a decimal large number. The command walrus convert-blob-id can be used to convert it to a base64 URL to be used by the command line tools and other APIs.
- [View System Information](/system-overview/view-system-info): Information about the Walrus system is available through the walrus info command. It provides an overview of current system parameters, such as the current epoch, the number of storage nodes and shards in the system, the maximum blob size, and the current cost in WAL for storing blobs:

Both address owned blobs and shared blobs can have their lifetime extended. Shared blobs can be extended by anyone, but owned blobs can only be extended by their owner. When extending a shared blob, you need to supply the --shared flag to inform the command that the blob is shared.
